# Apollo Backlog

## Closed in this sprint (Closure LXIX phase)
- [x] [patch] Reduce `apollo-fft` 1D precision dispatch duplication. Native
  f32 paths and mixed f16 non-power-of-two paths now share monomorphized
  `Complex32` forward/inverse helpers for conversion, twiddle-aware kernel
  dispatch, and real-output projection. `apollo-fft` was bumped to 0.9.4.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure LXVIII phase)
- [x] [patch] Reduce `apollo-fft` Bluestein plan-construction memory writes.
  The padded convolution filter now initializes overwritten mirrored chirp
  entries directly and zero-fills only the unused gap before the pre-transform.
  Generated scratch scripts and the generated Stockham broadcast experiment
  were removed from the deliverable scope. `apollo-fft` was bumped to 0.9.3.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure LXVII phase)
- [x] [patch] Consolidate `apollo-fft` plan-owned scratch allocation.
  1D Bluestein, 1D iRFFT, 2D/3D axis-pass, 3D R2C, and six-step f32 workspaces
  now share one sealed uninitialized workspace helper for scratch element types
  whose full contents are overwritten before read. `apollo-fft` was bumped to
  0.9.2.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure LXVI phase)
- [x] [patch] Reduce `apollo-fft` normalization and workspace memory overhead.
  Inverse scale passes now share AVX-capable normalization helpers, twiddle
  tables and composite twiddle tables fill exact pre-sized buffers, and
  overwritten FFT workspace buffers avoid zero-fill allocation cost.
  `apollo-fft` was bumped to 0.9.1.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure LXV phase)
- [x] [major] Remove concrete public auto-selector FFT wrappers from
  `apollo-fft`. Internal plans, tests, and benchmarks now use the canonical
  generic `fft_forward`, `fft_inverse`, and `fft_inverse_unnorm` entry points
  or the lower-level mixed-radix implementation where axis normalization
  requires it. `apollo-fft` was bumped to 0.9.0.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure LXIV phase)
- [x] [major] Remove the remaining public type-suffixed Winograd DFT-16/32/64
  wrappers. The recursive Winograd codelets now share one generic implementation
  family and mixed-radix dispatch calls the generic codelets directly.
  `apollo-fft` was bumped to 0.8.0.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure LXIII phase)
- [x] [major] Remove type-suffixed public short-Winograd wrappers for
  DFT-2/3/4/5/7/8 and twiddle multiplication. Mixed-radix dispatch now calls
  the canonical generic Winograd implementations directly, stale wrapper docs
  were removed, and `apollo-fft` was bumped to 0.7.0.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure LXII phase)
- [x] [major] Remove type-suffixed direct DFT wrappers and the debug-only f32
  parity binary from `apollo-fft`. Direct DFT tests, benchmarks, and kernel
  regressions now use the canonical generic `dft_forward` / `dft_inverse`
  functions, and `apollo-fft` was bumped to 0.6.0.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure LXI phase)
- [x] [patch] Reuse `apollo-fft` Bluestein and mixed-radix composite scratch
  buffers across calls and cache composite twiddle tables by exact radix
  decomposition plus direction. The composite cache no longer aliases different
  radix orders for the same length, stale allocation/`MaybeUninit` docs were
  removed, and `apollo-fft` was bumped to 0.5.3.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure LX phase)
- [x] [patch] Reduce `apollo-fft` typed 3D plan redundancy. The f32/f16 3D
  allocating and caller-owned paths now share one private monomorphized
  `Plan3dReal32` helper, the dead f32-only 3D real-to-complex writer was
  deleted, and `apollo-fft` was bumped to 0.5.2.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure LIX phase)
- [x] [patch] Reduce `apollo-fft` typed 2D plan redundancy and crate-root file
  size. The f32/f16 2D paths now share one private monomorphized
  `Plan2dReal32` helper, duplicated 2D plan Rustdoc was removed, crate-root
  tests moved into `lib_tests.rs`, and `apollo-fft` was bumped to 0.5.1.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure LVIII phase)
- [x] [major] Remove the stale `FftPlan3D::nz_complex` compatibility alias,
  rename `HalfSpectrum3D::nz_complex` to `HalfSpectrum3D::nz_c`, and remove
  stale compatibility wording from `apollo-fft`. The canonical half-spectrum
  bookkeeping name is `nz_c`; concrete precision kernel entry points remain
  documented as dispatch anchors for the generic `FftPrecision` API; and
  `apollo-fft` was bumped to 0.5.0.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure LVII phase)
- [x] [major] Remove the radix-specific f16 FFT module and custom `Cf16`
  wrapper from `apollo-fft`. Compact f16 complex storage now uses
  `num_complex::Complex<half::f16>`; the f16 execution bridge is a generic
  monomorphized `Complex32Bridge` with reusable thread-local scratch; the dead
  native f16 CPU gate and public f16-specific FFT wrappers were deleted; caller
  code and benchmarks now use the generic `fft_forward`/`fft_inverse` trait
  entry points; and `apollo-fft` was bumped to 0.4.0.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure LVI phase)
- [x] [patch] Integrate remote RustFFT comparator work with the current
  Stockham/composite/Bluestein FFT architecture. `apollo-fft` now uses the
  workspace `rustfft` dev-dependency, keeps the separate `vs_rustfft`
  benchmark, removes dead radix-specific benchmark rows for deleted kernels,
  routes exact 2/4/8/16/32/64 f64/f32 mixed-radix transforms through a shared
  static-dispatch short-Winograd helper, and removes unused f16 twiddle caches
  from the mixed-radix facade.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure LV phase)
- [x] [minor] Add caller-owned `apollo-hilbert` analytic observable
  projections and route envelope/phase through reusable analytic scratch.
  `AnalyticSignal` now exposes `*_into` projection methods for real,
  quadrature, envelope, phase, and instantaneous frequency; allocating
  projection methods delegate to the same non-generic helpers; `HilbertPlan`
  exposes `envelope_into` and `phase_into`; plan-level envelope/phase avoid
  per-call owned analytic vectors; parity/mismatch/capacity tests cover the new
  paths; and `apollo-hilbert` was bumped to 0.3.0.
- [x] [minor] Add caller-owned `apollo-hilbert` analytic-signal execution and
  remove per-call analytic allocation from caller-owned quadrature. The direct
  kernel now exposes `analytic_signal_into`, `HilbertPlan` exposes
  `analytic_signal_into`, owned analytic execution routes through the
  caller-owned path, quadrature projection reuses a thread-local Complex64
  analytic scratch buffer, crate-root docs no longer claim private DFT
  ownership, parity/capacity/mismatch tests cover the new paths, and
  `apollo-hilbert` was bumped to 0.2.0.
- [x] [minor] Add `apollo-fft` 1D real-forward slice execution and remove the
  final `apollo-hilbert` ndarray input bridge. `FftPlan1D` now exposes one
  non-generic caller-owned slice path that the existing ndarray path delegates
  to, Hilbert analytic-signal execution uses the cached FFT plan directly on
  real slices, 1D precision methods and tests were split into leaf modules so
  `dimension_1d.rs` stays below 500 lines, `apollo-hilbert` no longer depends
  on `ndarray`, `apollo-fft` was bumped to 0.3.0, and `apollo-hilbert` was
  bumped to 0.1.4.
- [x] [patch] Remove `apollo-hilbert` analytic-signal spectrum and inverse
  copy allocations. The owner kernel now keeps the forward FFT output as the
  analytic spectrum, applies the Hilbert mask in place, runs the complex
  inverse in place, moves the contiguous buffer out once for the allocating
  API, routes owned quadrature through the caller-owned writer, and bumps
  `apollo-hilbert` to 0.1.3.
- [x] [patch] Remove `apollo-hilbert` caller-owned quadrature copy-through
  allocation and dead direct `rayon` dependency. The owner kernel now exposes a
  slice-level quadrature writer, `HilbertPlan::transform_into` routes through
  it, typed transform workspaces inherit the allocation reduction, direct
  kernel parity/mismatch tests cover the new path, and `apollo-hilbert` was
  bumped to 0.1.2.
- [x] [patch] Remove `apollo-hilbert` typed quadrature and analytic input
  bridge allocations. Typed Hilbert `f32`/`f16` paths now reuse thread-local
  f64 input/output workspaces, keep `f64` storage on the zero-copy owner path,
  preserve shared analytic-mask execution, add repeated-call capacity/value
  coverage, and bump `apollo-hilbert` to 0.1.1.
- [x] [patch] Remove `apollo-sdft` typed direct-bin bridge allocations. Typed
  direct-bin execution now reuses thread-local f64 input and Complex64 output
  workspaces, keeps arithmetic in the shared direct-bin owner kernel, adds
  repeated-call capacity/value coverage, and bumps `apollo-sdft` to 0.1.1.
- [x] [patch] Remove `apollo-stft` inverse WOLA per-call workspace
  allocations. `inverse_into`, `inverse`, and typed inverse now reuse
  thread-local frame, complex, overlap, and weight workspaces through the
  shared slice-level inverse owner path; repeated-call value tests prove
  capacity reuse; the ADR now reflects the owner inverse workspace design; and
  `apollo-stft` was bumped to 0.2.1.
- [x] [major] Remove `apollo-stft` per-call typed bridge allocations and
  deprecated allocating alias methods. STFT typed forward/inverse now reuse
  thread-local f64/Complex64 bridge workspaces through shared slice-level
  kernels, storage/profile traits moved to a dedicated leaf module, the 1D
  plan file is below the 500-line structural limit, a co-located ADR records
  the breaking cleanup, and `apollo-stft` was bumped to 0.2.0.
- [x] [patch] Remove `apollo-qft` plan-path dense output allocation and typed
  Complex64 bridge allocations. QFT dense kernels now expose caller-owned
  output execution, plan `forward_into`/`inverse_into` route through slices,
  typed paths reuse thread-local Complex64 input/output workspaces, and
  `apollo-qft` was bumped to 0.1.1.
- [x] [patch] Remove per-call `apollo-gft` typed storage f64 bridge
  allocations. GFT typed paths now reuse thread-local f64 input/output
  workspaces through slice-level graph-basis multiply, and `apollo-gft` was
  bumped to 0.1.1.
- [x] [patch] Remove per-call `apollo-fwht` typed storage bridge and f16
  compute allocations. FWHT typed defaults now reuse thread-local f64
  input/output workspaces through slice-level f64 execution, mixed f16 paths
  reuse a thread-local f32 compute workspace, and `apollo-fwht` was bumped to
  0.1.1.
- [x] [patch] Remove per-call `apollo-czt` plan-path convolution and typed
  bridge allocations. `CztPlan` now owns a reusable Bluestein convolution
  workspace, precomputes square-plan inverse Vandermonde nodes, exposes
  internal Complex64 slice execution for typed storage, and reuses thread-local
  Complex64 typed input/output workspaces. `apollo-czt` was bumped to 0.2.1.
- [x] [patch] Remove newly surfaced `apollo-fft` dead radix-2 butterfly helper
  section after the Stockham path became canonical, add missing `FftPlan3D`
  Rustdoc, and bump `apollo-fft` to 0.2.2.
- [x] [patch] Remove per-call `apollo-frft` typed-storage Complex64 bridge
  allocations. `Complex32` and `[f16; 2]` FrFT paths now reuse thread-local
  Complex64 input/output workspaces and call internal slice entry points on the
  canonical direct FrFT kernel, eliminating two O(N) heap allocations per typed
  forward/inverse call. `apollo-frft` was bumped to 0.1.2.
- [x] [patch] Restore `apollo-fft` dependency compilation after current module
  header drift. Reinstated the kernel module declarations/`FftPrecision` trait
  header; `apollo-fft` was bumped to 0.2.1.
- [x] [patch] Remove current `apollo-fft` dead generic helper surface. Deleted
  the unused f16 with-twiddles bridge, obsolete uniform power-of-two
  digit-reversal helper, obsolete power-of-four/eight shape predicates, and
  unused Winograd stage traits after Stockham/composite routing became
  canonical.
- [x] [patch] Remove per-call `apollo-frft` unitary coefficient allocation.
  `UnitaryFrftPlan` now reuses a thread-local O(N) coefficient workspace for
  `V^T x`, phase multiplication, and reconstruction, preserving the
  Candan-Grünbaum unitary DFrFT contract while eliminating repeated heap
  allocation in forward/inverse calls. Removed stale backward-compatibility
  wording on live crate-root exports and bumped `apollo-frft` to 0.1.1.
- [x] [major] Remove remaining `apollo-fft` compatibility re-export surfaces.
  Public root exports now point directly at canonical `application`,
  `domain::contracts`, and `domain::metadata` owners; in-repo callers no longer
  use `apollo_fft::{backend,error,types}` or `apollo_fft::application::plan`.
  The legacy `FFT_CACHE` alias and unused
  `infrastructure::cpu::simd::power_of_two::{radix4,radix8}` forwarding modules
  were removed, and `apollo-fft` was bumped to 0.2.0.
- [x] [major] Remove deprecated `apollo-stft-wgpu` non-power-of-two error
  variant and explicit dead-code suppressions. `FrameLenNotPowerOfTwo` was no
  longer returned after Chirp-Z support; non-power-of-two tests now assert
  successful forward, inverse, and reusable-buffer paths. GPU-retained buffer
  fields now use `_`-prefixed ownership names instead of `#[allow(dead_code)]`.
- [x] [patch] Remove remaining WGPU dead-code suppressions in NUFFT/NTT cleanup.
  NUFFT reusable buffers now reject dispatches whose sample count exceeds the
  pre-allocated capacity before any GPU write, and NTT reusable buffers removed
  duplicated scalar `n_inv` storage while retaining GPU resources through
  `_`-prefixed ownership fields.
- [x] [patch] Remove NUFFT-WGPU per-dispatch layout-placeholder allocations.
  Fast Type-1 and 3D Type-2 paths now bind one retained `layout_padding_buffer`
  for shader entries that are structurally required by the shared layout but not
  read by that entry point.
- [x] [patch] Remove dead `apollo-dctdst` DCT-II/DST-II fast-path output
  allocations. Single-projection fast DCT-II/DST-II now reuse the 2N-point FFT
  setup and fill only the requested projection instead of allocating an N-length
  unused sibling output.
- [x] [patch] Continue Apollo-vs-RustFFT f32 N=4096 investigation. Reject disabling
  the f32 N=4096 radix-16 quad suffix: same-session Criterion measured Apollo
  6.5098 µs vs RustFFT 3.7433 µs with the quad predicate disabled.
- [x] [patch] Restore local `vs_rustfft` benchmark compilation against the current
  public API by adding the missing RustFFT dev-dependency, registering the bench,
  repairing Winograd typed entry points, and routing the untracked benchmark
  through the present mixed-radix precomputed-twiddle surface.
- [x] [patch] Record residual performance gap: current f32 N=4096
  precomputed-twiddle row measures Apollo 22.790 µs vs RustFFT 3.5969 µs. This
  row is not comparable to the earlier plan-scratch row because the plan-scratch
  API used by that row is absent in this checkout.
- [x] [patch] Route large f32 power-of-two mixed-radix dispatch through the
  monomorphized Stockham scratch-backed kernel instead of the radix-8 facade.
  Final retained f32 N=4096 Criterion measured Apollo zero-alloc reused
  7.0463 µs, Apollo caller-twiddle reused 8.9737 µs, and RustFFT reused
  6.2814 µs. Rejected the initial production 8x512 hybrid and direct
  no-argument micro-dispatch probes because both regressed the then-retained
  route.
- [x] [patch] Improve f32 N=4096 Stockham scheduling and public-path cache
  overhead. Disable the spilling radix-16 quad suffix on the retained
  scratch-backed path, keep the stride-64 triple suppression, and add a
  single-entry thread-local f32 forward-twiddle fast cache that borrows the
  cached table instead of cloning `Arc` on each public call. Longer Criterion
  measured Apollo zero-alloc reused 6.3347 µs, Apollo caller-twiddle reused
  6.0315 µs, and RustFFT reused 4.2974 µs.
- [x] [patch] Audit and reject the terminal groups=1 in-place Stockham hook:
  the groups=1 source layout is interleaved (`src[2j]`, `src[2j+1]`), while
  the hook assumed split halves and was not a valid generic copyback removal.
  Retain the f32 public dispatch inlining and consolidated f32 Stockham
  workspace, and reject the static N=4096 twiddle specialization because it
  regressed Apollo public zero-alloc to 5.4357 µs.
- [x] [patch] Reject the promoted f32 8x512 N=4096 production route after
  same-tree Criterion showed the generic Stockham route was faster. Retain the
  f32 N=4096 radix-8/radix-8 tail schedule and split public scratch/twiddle
  cache, removing the dead combined workspace. Final retained Criterion
  measured Apollo public zero-alloc reused 5.4298 µs, Apollo caller-twiddle
  reused 5.2661 µs, and RustFFT reused 3.6958 µs; an earlier same-state run
  measured Apollo public 4.8645 µs and caller-twiddle 4.7913 µs, so the
  remaining spread is benchmark variance.
- [x] [patch] Continue f32 N=4096 probe discipline. Reject the 64 KiB low-live
  threshold, a separate single-entry Stockham twiddle cache, a direct N=4096
  four-pass specialization, and unchecked twiddle subslices because repeated
  Criterion did not show a stable retained improvement.
- [x] [patch] Continue f32 N=4096 monomorphization and memory-efficiency probes.
  Reject stride-64 radix-16 fusion after Criterion regressed Apollo public to
  9.7711 µs and caller-twiddle to 9.3225 µs versus RustFFT 3.7232 µs. Reject
  forced `#[inline(always)]` at the Stockham AVX/cache boundaries because rustc
  rejects the target-feature combination and repeat Criterion did not retain an
  improvement. Current retained run after reverts measured Apollo public
  5.4895 µs, Apollo caller-twiddle 5.4176 µs, and RustFFT 4.3328 µs.
- [x] [patch] Continue f32 N=4096 hot-codelet probes. Reject paired 128-bit
  stores in the quarter-groups-one suffix because Criterion regressed Apollo
  public to 7.1908 µs and caller-twiddle to 6.1711 µs versus RustFFT
  3.8321 µs. Reject even-radix tail monomorphization and const-generic
  radix-1 quarter-turn signs because repeat Criterion did not retain a caller
  improvement and the const-sign probe regressed the public row to 8.1940 µs.
- [x] [patch] Continue assembly-level f32 N=4096 investigation. Release assembly
  showed the Windows ABI saves XMM6-XMM15 around the separate f32 Stockham
  codelets. A private raw-pointer `sysv64` ABI removed the XMM save block from
  the suffix assembly, but focused Criterion did not retain a kernel-row
  improvement: first combined run measured Apollo caller-twiddle 5.4358 µs
  versus RustFFT 3.5192 µs, while repeat measured Apollo caller-twiddle
  7.7158 µs versus RustFFT 5.2601 µs. Reverted the ABI probe.
- [x] [patch] Add nonsimd scalar permutation cleanup. Replace generic
  power-of-two digit reversal division/modulo with shift/mask digit extraction
  in the shared radix permutation helper. This is SWAR-adjacent scalar work for
  non-Stockham routes; focused f32 N=256 Criterion remained effectively neutral
  at Apollo public 983.67 ns and caller-twiddle 991.61 ns, so the residual
  N=256 gap is in radix-4 butterflies/scheduling rather than digit reversal.
- [x] [patch] Expand f32 forward autosort coverage. Lower the f32 Stockham
  dispatch threshold from 1024 to 256 so N=256 bypasses radix-4 digit reversal.
  Focused Criterion improved N=256 from the prior digit-reversal route near
  983.67 ns public / 991.61 ns caller-twiddle to 197.50 ns public /
  218.36 ns caller-twiddle on repeat. Rejected lowering the threshold to 64:
  N=64 public regressed to 64.969 ns while caller-twiddle was neutral.
- [x] [patch] Integrate f32 inverse autosort coverage and benchmark it. Route
  f32 power-of-two inverse paths at lengths >=256 through Stockham with inverse
  twiddles, and scale explicitly for normalized inverse. Add inverse zero-alloc
  rows to `vs_rustfft`. Focused Criterion showed old inverse digit-reversal
  baseline at 963.10 ns for N=256 and 23.104 µs for N=4096, while retained
  Stockham inverse measured 230.60 ns and 5.5408 µs after restoration.
- [x] [patch] Expand f64 autosort coverage for forward and inverse
  power-of-two paths at lengths >=256. Add f64 inverse zero-allocation
  benchmark rows and an N=256 forward+normalized-inverse value test. Focused
  Criterion showed the old f64 digit-reversal baseline at 830.23 ns forward /
  778.38 ns inverse for N=256 and 25.456 µs forward / 32.167 µs inverse for
  N=4096; retained Stockham measured 315.24 ns / 257.88 ns and 10.050 µs /
  10.731 µs. Rejected f64 threshold 64 because it regressed N=64 public and
  caller-twiddle rows.
- [x] [patch] Improve N=256/N=512 Stockham memory efficiency by removing
  production f64 N=256/N=512 and f32 N=512 fixed single-pass kernels from
  dispatch in favor of the fused generic AVX scheduler. Focused Criterion
  measured f64 N=256 at 255.90 ns public / 228.16 ns caller-twiddle /
  225.37 ns inverse, f64 N=512 at 591.36 ns public / 581.33 ns caller-twiddle,
  and f32 N=512 at 366.39 ns public / 346.71 ns caller-twiddle /
  328.85 ns inverse. Added N=512 f32/f64 roundtrip tests.
- [x] [patch] Add a static f32 N=4096 four-triple Stockham schedule that skips
  the generic scheduler loop and directly executes the four retained radix-8
  fused stages. Focused Criterion improved f32 N=4096 caller-twiddle forward
  from 6.9498 µs to 5.4670 µs and inverse from 6.5585 µs to 5.1970 µs in the
  same retained benchmark history, but RustFFT still measured 3.7807 µs
  forward and 3.7765 µs inverse on the latest run. Rejected the same static
  N=4096 schedule for f64 because it regressed forward to 11.264 µs, and
  rejected an f32 N=512 no-copy tail schedule because it regressed forward to
  440.90 ns and inverse to 570.83 ns.
- [x] [patch] Probe RustFFT-like f32 8x512 production decomposition using the
  verified column radix-8 step, mixed twiddles, retained row-local N=512 fused
  Stockham, and final transpose. Correctness held, but Criterion regressed
  f32 N=4096 forward/inverse to 11.792 µs / 11.786 µs. Reordering the final
  transpose to contiguous destination stores improved the failed route to
  9.9378 µs / 9.9228 µs but remained slower than the retained four-triple
  schedule, so the production probe was reverted.
- [x] [patch] Implement and reject a f32 Butterfly512-style 8x64 production
  candidate. It used the verified radix-8 column pass, mixed twiddles, eight
  fixed 64-point row butterflies, and final transpose. Correctness held, but
  Criterion regressed N=512 forward/inverse to 546.25 ns / 573.94 ns versus the
  retained fused scheduler. A vectorized mixed-twiddle variant regressed
  forward further to 773.36 ns, so the production dispatch was reverted.
- [x] [patch] Audit the complete RustFFT `Butterfly512Avx` pathway and encode
  its twiddle-layout precondition as Apollo tests. The prior 8x64 candidate was
  arithmetically valid but did not satisfy RustFFT's actual 16x32 base-kernel
  memory contract. New f32/f64 tests pin the separated-column packed twiddle
  order used by the fused twiddle+transpose stage, giving the next production
  kernel a verified layout target without weakening the retained dispatch.
- [x] [patch] Benchmark the current open zero-allocation rows and retain only
  measured improvements. Rejected production f32/f64 N=512 fixed single-pass
  leaves because they regressed both precisions. Retained f64 N=4096
  forward-only static four-triple dispatch selected by the forward twiddle sign:
  current baseline Apollo forward 17.686 µs improved to 15.844 µs, while inverse
  stays on the generic schedule because the same static schedule regressed
  inverse under inverse twiddles.
- [x] [patch] Improve 3D R2C/C2R memory efficiency by eliminating per-row
  temporary `Vec<Complex64>` allocation in the Z-axis split/extraction passes.
  Forward R2C now packs the length-`nz/2` complex subproblem into the
  caller-owned half-spectrum row prefix; inverse C2R reuses the mutable
  half-spectrum scratch row for recovered packed spectrum values before the
  sub-IFFT. Removed unused f32 R2C future-reservation fields and their plan-time
  allocations.
- [x] [patch] Reject the closure-borrowed thread-local twiddle cache probe.
  It removed hot-path `Arc` clones in source form but regressed focused f32
  N=4096 public zero-allocation Criterion to 8.4200 µs median. Restored the
  retained cache route; the repeat row measured 7.0245 µs median in this
  session.
- [x] [patch] Remove unreachable 2D FFT fallback lane materialization.
  `FftPlan2D` axis dispatch only calls `Axis(0)` and `Axis(1)`; the previous
  fallback for impossible axes allocated `Vec<Vec<Complex64>>` or
  `Vec<Vec<Complex32>>`, copied every lane, transformed the nested buffers, and
  scattered them back. The invalid-axis branch is now an explicit invariant, so
  row/column fast paths remain the only production paths.
- [x] [patch] Correct the monomorphized generic DFT-8 twiddle sign used by the
  composite-radix path. The generic Winograd helper now uses forward roots
  `exp(-2πik/8)` and inverse roots `exp(+2πik/8)` for both f64 and f32,
  restoring composite sizes such as N=24, N=48, N=192, N=384, N=1000, and
  N=10000 without reintroducing type-specific helper clones.
- [x] [major] Remove deprecated FFT compatibility aliases. Deleted
  `FftPlan1D/2D/3D::{forward_into,inverse_into}` forwarding methods and the
  legacy `ProcessorFft3d` type alias, then updated in-repo Python bindings to
  call `forward_real_to_complex_into` / `inverse_complex_to_real_into`
  directly. This leaves one authoritative caller-owned API surface.

## Open performance target
- [ ] [patch] Surpass RustFFT across the full `vs_rustfft` zero-allocation
  matrix. Current retained rows already beat RustFFT for f64 N=512 forward and
  inverse and intermittently for f32 N=256 forward, but f64 N=256, f64 N=4096,
  f32 N=512, and f32 N=4096 remain open gaps.
- [ ] [patch] Replace the retained N=512/N=4096 f32 Stockham base path with a
  complete 16x32 Butterfly512 pathway: column butterfly16, packed twiddle
  multiply, fused 4x4 transpose stores, row butterfly32, then mixed-radix8xn
  composition for N=4096.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure XXV phase)
- [x] [patch] GPU adapter selection: replaced all 20 `wgpu::RequestAdapterOptions::default()`
  sites with `PowerPreference::HighPerformance` across all wgpu crates (fft-wgpu, czt-wgpu,
  mellin-wgpu, ntt-wgpu, stft-wgpu, radon-wgpu, nufft-wgpu, hilbert-wgpu, sft-wgpu, qft-wgpu,
  frft-wgpu, fwht-wgpu, dht-wgpu, sdft-wgpu, sht-wgpu, dctdst-wgpu, gft-wgpu, wavelet-wgpu,
  f16_plan.rs, buffer_reuse bench). Ensures NVIDIA discrete GPU preferred over integrated.
- [x] [patch] GPU test runtime-skip conversion: removed all `#[ignore]` attributes from
  `apollo-ntt-wgpu` (10 tests) and `apollo-stft-wgpu` (7 tests); replaced with
  `let Ok(backend) = Backend::try_default() else { return; }` early-return pattern.
- [x] [patch] Bluestein CZT sign convention fix in `apollo-stft-wgpu`: corrected all four sign
  errors in `stft_chirp.wgsl` (premul_fwd: exp(-πi·n²/N), premul_inv: exp(+πi·n²/N),
  postmul_fwd: exp(-πi·k²/N), postmul_inv: exp(+πi·n²/N)/N); added
  `stft_chirp_pointmul_fwd` entry point (conjugates h_stored → h_fwd); added
  `pointmul_fwd_pipeline` to `StftChirpData`; updated `execute_forward_fft_chirp` to
  dispatch `pointmul_fwd_pipeline` instead of `pointmul_pipeline`.
- [x] [patch] Non-PoT buffer-reuse routing fix in `apollo-stft-wgpu`: added POT guard to
  `execute_forward_with_buffers` and `execute_inverse_with_buffers` that delegates to
  the allocating Chirp-Z path and copies results into `fwd_output_host`/`inv_output_host`.
  Updated forward CZT test tolerance from 1e-2 to 2e-2 (analytically justified by f32
  GPU argument-reduction error at phase magnitudes up to ~1254 rad for N=400).
- Final state: `cargo test --workspace` 0 FAILED, 0 ignored across all 38+ crates.

- [x] [patch] ARCHITECTURE.md Mixed-Precision Capability Table: added "forward + inverse CZT" and
  "forward + inverse Mellin spectrum" annotations to the Notes column for `apollo-czt-wgpu` and
  `apollo-mellin-wgpu`, matching the established pattern for other bidirectional WGPU crates.
- [x] [patch] apollo-validation two new published-reference fixtures (fixtures 29 and 30):
  `czt_inverse_vandermonde_roundtrip_fixture` (threshold 1e-12; N=4 Björck-Pereyra) and
  `mellin_inverse_spectrum_constant_roundtrip_fixture` (threshold 1e-10; N=32 constant signal).
  Added `published_real_fixture_with_threshold` helper. Updated README.md fixture count 28 → 30.
  Assertion in `validation_suite_produces_value_semantic_reports` updated to 30. All 30 pass.

- [x] [patch] Implement GPU benchmark runner infrastructure: manual self-hosted workflow
## Closed in this sprint (Closure XXV phase)

  new method using the complex-derivative formula
  `f[n] = arg(conj(z[n])·z[n+1]) / (2π)` (length N−1, cycles per sample).
  Avoids phase unwrapping; well-defined whenever |z[n]| > 0. Reference: Boashash (1992).
- [x] [patch] Two new verification tests in `apollo-hilbert`:
  `instantaneous_frequency_constant_tone` (cosine at k/N has IF=k/N, ε<1e-10) and
  `double_hilbert_negates_zero_mean_signal` (H{H{x}}=−x for sinusoidal signals, ε<1e-10).
- [x] [patch] Validation fixture 31 in `apollo-validation`:
  `hilbert_instantaneous_frequency_constant_tone_fixture` (N=64, k=5, threshold 1e-10).
  Root README updated 30→31; fixture count assertions updated in both test functions.
- [x] [patch] `apollo-hilbert/README.md`: added "Instantaneous Frequency" subsection
  documenting the complex-derivative formula, validation fixture reference, and Boashash 1992 cite.
- [x] [patch] `CHANGELOG.md`, `gap_audit.md`, `checklist.md` updated for Closure XXV.
- [x] [patch] Ignored doc-test in `apollo-ntt-wgpu/src/verification.rs` converted from
  `rust,ignore` to `rust,no_run` with `# use apollo_ntt_wgpu::NttWgpuBackend;` preamble.
  Eliminated last remaining ignored test in workspace; doc-test now compiles and reports "ok".
- [x] [patch] `execute_inverse_with_buffers` doc comment in `apollo-stft-wgpu/src/infrastructure/device.rs`:
  expanded from stub ("Reuses GPU resources from buffers.") to full description noting
  non-PoT delegation and `WgpuError::InvalidPlan` conditions.

*(Remaining open gap: hardware-gated benchmark timing ratios for NUFFT/STFT buffer-reuse paths.)*

## Closed in this sprint (Closure XIX phase)
- [x] [minor] Update `StftGpuBuffers` for non-PoT scratch sizing via `chirp_padded_len(frame_len)`;
  remove `FrameLenNotPowerOfTwo` from `make_buffers`, `execute_forward_with_buffers`,
  `execute_inverse_with_buffers`. Unblocks buffer-reuse path for non-PoT `frame_len`.
  Version: 0.10.0 [minor]. Tests: 1 structural + 2 GPU-gated buffer-reuse.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure XVIII phase)
- [x] [minor] Bluestein/Chirp-Z non-PoT STFT GPU path: five-pass WGSL dispatch
  (`stft_chirp.wgsl`, `stft_chirp_fft.wgsl`), `StftChirpData` GPU resource struct,
  conditional dispatch in `kernel.rs` (Radix-2 for PoT, Chirp-Z for non-PoT),
  `FrameLenNotPowerOfTwo` removed from primary dispatch path in `device.rs`,
  `error.rs` variant doc updated, 5 new verification tests (3 structural, 2 GPU-gated).
  ADR: `design_history_file/adr_stft_wgpu_non_pot_chirpz.md`. Version: 0.9.0 [minor].

## Closed in this sprint (Closure XVII phase)
- [x] [patch] Add `bench_forward_reuse` and `bench_inverse_reuse` benchmark groups to
  `crates/apollo-stft-wgpu/benches/stft_bench.rs`: head-to-head allocating vs
  `StftGpuBuffers` buffer-reuse comparison at `frame_len` ∈ {256, 512, 1024}.
  Mirrors the pattern of `apollo-fft-wgpu/benches/buffer_reuse.rs`.
- [x] [patch] Add "Buffer Reuse" and "Benchmarks" sections to
  `crates/apollo-stft-wgpu/README.md` documenting the
  `make_buffers` → `execute_forward/inverse_with_buffers` usage pattern,
  constraint notes, and bench invocation.

## Planned next increments
*(No gaps blocking next sprint at this time. STFT GPU PoT/non-PoT complete; buffer-reuse enabled.)*

## Closed in this sprint (Closure XVI phase)
- [x] [minor] `StftGpuBuffers` pre-allocated buffer reuse in `apollo-stft-wgpu`:
  construct once per `(frame_count, frame_len, signal_len, hop_len)` quad; eliminates
  5–8 `device.create_buffer`, 4+ `device.create_bind_group`, and `log₂(N)` uniform-buffer
  allocations per dispatch. Mirrors `GpuFft3dBuffers` pattern from `apollo-fft-wgpu`.
- [x] [minor] `StftWgpuBackend::make_buffers`, `execute_forward_with_buffers`,
  `execute_inverse_with_buffers` — public API surface for zero-allocation repeated dispatch.
- [x] [minor] `StftGpuKernel::execute_forward_fft_with_buffers` and
  `execute_inverse_with_buffers` — kernel-level buffered dispatch methods.
- [x] [minor] Verification test `reusable_buffers_match_allocating_forward_and_inverse_when_device_exists`:
  asserts bit-exact agreement (TOL=1e-6) between allocating and buffered forward+inverse paths;
  verifies idempotent second-call buffer reuse.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure XV phase)
- [x] [patch] Criterion benchmark suite for `apollo-radon-wgpu`: new `benches/radon_wgpu_bench.rs`
  with `radon_wgpu_forward` and `radon_wgpu_fbp` groups across three image sizes (64², 128², 256²).
  Gaussian disk phantom (σ=0.25) provides non-trivial frequency content; analytical Radon transform
  is `(Rf)(θ,s) = σ√(2π)·exp(−s²/(2σ²))`. Angles uniform on `[0,π)` (Fourier slice theorem
  sampling). Addresses open gap #2 from `gap_audit.md` (Criterion GPU benchmark infrastructure).
- [x] [patch] Add `criterion = "0.5"` to `apollo-radon-wgpu` dev-deps;
  add `[[bench]] name = "radon_wgpu_bench" harness = false`.

- [x] [patch] Dead-code removal in `apollo-stft-wgpu`: remove deprecated O(N²) forward
  pipeline (`StftGpuKernel::execute`, `forward_pipeline` field, `stft.wgsl` shader).
  Remove dead `stft_inverse_frames` entry point from `stft_inverse.wgsl` (superseded by
  Closure XI FFT inverse path). Update kernel module docstring, `WORKGROUP_SIZE` comment,
  struct doc, and `dispatch_count`/`fft_dispatch_count` comments. -244 net lines removed.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure XIII phase)
- [x] [patch] Criterion benchmark suite for `apollo-stft-wgpu`: new `benches/stft_bench.rs`
  with `bench_forward_fft` and `bench_inverse_fft` groups across three COLA-valid
  `(frame_len, hop_len, signal_len)` parameter sets: (256/128/4096), (512/256/8192),
  (1024/512/16384). Addresses open gap #2 from `gap_audit.md` (Criterion buffer-reuse
  bench results on GPU hardware). Skips gracefully when no WGPU device is available.
- [x] [patch] Add `criterion = { version = "0.5", features = ["html_reports"] }` to
  `apollo-stft-wgpu` dev-deps; add `[[bench]] name = "stft_bench" harness = false`.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure XII phase)
- [x] [minor] STFT forward GPU acceleration (`apollo-stft-wgpu`): replace O(N²) per-frame
  direct DFT in `stft.wgsl::stft_forward` with a batched Cooley-Tukey Radix-2 DIT FFT
  (O(N log N) per frame). New `stft_forward_fft.wgsl` with four entry points:
  `stft_fwd_pack_window` (Hann analysis window + pack to split re/im scratch),
  `stft_fwd_bitrev` (bit-reversal permutation, batched), `stft_fwd_butterfly` (one Radix-2
  DIT stage per dispatch, DFT twiddle exp(−2πi·k/N)), `stft_fwd_interleave` (split re/im →
  interleaved ComplexValue output). Reuses `fft_data_bgl` and `fft_params_bgl` layouts
  from the inverse FFT path. New `FwdFftStageParams` (16 bytes, 4×u32) carries `hop_len`
  where `FftStageParams._pad` was. `FrameLenNotPowerOfTwo` enforced on forward path.
  Formal basis: Cooley & Tukey (1965).
- [x] [patch] New `forward_rejects_non_power_of_two_frame_len` test (CPU-only).
- [x] [patch] New `forward_fft_roundtrip_large_frame_when_device_exists` test (GPU-gated).

## Closed in this sprint (Closure XI phase)
- [x] [minor] STFT inverse GPU acceleration (`apollo-stft-wgpu`): replace O(N²) per-frame direct IDFT in `stft_inverse.wgsl::stft_inverse_frames` with a batched Cooley-Tukey Radix-2 DIT IFFT (O(N log N) per frame). New `stft_inverse_fft.wgsl` with four entry points: `stft_deinterleave` (interleaved f32 → split re/im scratch), `stft_bitrev` (bit-reversal permutation, batched), `stft_butterfly` (one Radix-2 DIT stage per dispatch, IDFT twiddle exp(+2πi·k/N)), `stft_scale_and_window` (1/N scale + Hann synthesis window → frame_data). Two-bind-group architecture: group 0 (4 data bindings, shared), group 1 (per-stage FftStageParams uniform, one bind group per butterfly pass). All passes encoded in one `CommandEncoder`; implicit per-pass memory barriers preserve write visibility. OLA pass unchanged. Formal basis: Cooley & Tukey (1965); Allen & Rabiner (1977) Theorem 1.
- [x] [minor] New `WgpuError::FrameLenNotPowerOfTwo { frame_len: usize }` variant: returned by `execute_inverse` when `frame_len` is not a power of two (Radix-2 invariant). Checked in both `device.rs` (pre-dispatch) and `kernel.rs` (IFFT entry). [minor because it is an additive public API change to an existing error enum]
- [x] [patch] STFT-WGPU verification: new test `inverse_rejects_non_power_of_two_frame_len` (frame_len=6, expects `FrameLenNotPowerOfTwo`). New GPU-gated test `inverse_roundtrip_large_frame_1024_samples_when_device_exists` (frame_len=1024, hop=512, signal_len=8192, analytic sine reference, TOL=5e-3) exercising all 10 butterfly stages.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure X phase)
- [x] [minor] GPU Radon Filtered Backprojection (`apollo-radon-wgpu`): new `radon_fbp_filter.wgsl` with entry `radon_fbp_filter` performing circular convolution of each projection row with the ramp filter impulse response `h = IFFT(R)`, `R[k] = 2π·|signed_k|/(N·Δ)` (Bracewell & Riddle 1967; Shepp & Logan 1974). `h` computed host-side via `apollo_radon::ramp_filter_projection` applied to unit impulse, then cast to f32. Reuses existing 4-binding bind group layout. Two-pass single encoder: filter pass → backproject pass. Host-side `π/angle_count` normalization. `fbp_filter_pipeline` in `RadonGpuKernel`. `RadonWgpuBackend::execute_filtered_backproject`. `supports_filtered_backprojection` capability flag. `forward_inverse_and_fbp` constructor. 4 verification tests: adjoint identity (⟨Af,g⟩=⟨f,A†g⟩), FBP capability flags, FBP matches CPU reference (TOL=5e-2), FBP shape mismatch rejection.
- [x] [patch] Radon-WGPU adjoint identity test: `backproject_satisfies_adjoint_identity_when_device_exists` verifies ⟨A·f, g⟩_sinogram = ⟨f, A†·g⟩_image (Natterer 2001, §II.2) to relative tolerance 5e-3. Uses CPU forward (f64) + GPU backproject (f32). Tests the mathematical definition of the adjoint operator.
- [x] [patch] STFT-WGPU parameterized roundtrip test: `inverse_roundtrip_for_multiple_cola_parameter_sets` tests three COLA-compliant parameter sets (frame_len=8/hop=4, frame_len=16/hop=8, frame_len=32/hop=16) with analytical sine/cosine reference signals. CPU forward → GPU inverse → compare with CPU inverse reference at TOL=5e-3.
- [x] [patch] Documentation sync: updated `README.md` WGPU crate descriptions to reflect GPU inverse capabilities for `apollo-radon-wgpu` (FBP added), `apollo-stft-wgpu` (inverse WOLA), `apollo-hilbert-wgpu` (inverse analytic-mask), `apollo-sdft-wgpu` (inverse IDFT). Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` Mixed-Precision Capability Table notes for the same four crates.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure IX phase)
- [x] [minor] GPU inverse STFT WOLA (`apollo-stft-wgpu`): new `stft_inverse.wgsl` with two-pass WOLA reconstruction (`stft_inverse_frames`: per-(frame, local_j) windowed IDFT using interleaved f32 spectrum; `stft_inverse_ola`: per-sample OLA with Hann² weight normalization); shared 3-binding layout reusing existing `bind_group_layout`; `inverse_frames_pipeline` + `inverse_ola_pipeline` in `StftGpuKernel`; `StftGpuKernel::execute_inverse` (2-pass single encoder); `StftWgpuBackend::execute_inverse(plan, spectrum, signal_len)` + `execute_inverse_typed_into`; `forward_and_inverse` capability constructor; 3 new verification tests (`capabilities_reflect_forward_and_inverse_surface`, `inverse_roundtrip_recovers_cola_signal_when_device_exists`, `inverse_matches_cpu_reference_for_16sample_signal`). Basis: WOLA identity (Allen–Rabiner 1977, Theorem 1).
- [x] [minor] GPU Radon backprojection (`apollo-radon-wgpu`): new `radon_backproject.wgsl` entry point — per-pixel `bp[r,c] = Σ_θ interp(sinogram[θ,·], x·cosθ + y·sinθ)` with linear interpolation; reuses forward bind group layout; `backproject_pipeline` in `RadonGpuKernel`; `RadonGpuKernel::execute_backproject`; `RadonWgpuBackend::execute_inverse(plan, sinogram, angles)` + `execute_inverse_flat_typed`; `SinogramShapeMismatch` error variant; `forward_and_inverse` capability constructor; 3 new verification tests. Basis: Radon adjoint operator (Natterer 2001, §II.2).
- [x] [patch] Correct `gap_audit.md` open-gap note: CZT and Mellin have no CPU inverse defined (`apollo-czt` has only `forward`; `apollo-mellin` has `forward_resample`/`moment`/`forward_spectrum` only). GPU inverse for those two crates is `UnsupportedExecution` by architectural design, not deferral. Updated open gaps section accordingly.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure VIII phase)
- [x] [minor] GPU inverse Hilbert transform (`apollo-hilbert-wgpu`): `hilbert_inverse_mask` WGSL entry point (DC/Nyquist zeroed, positive: X[k]=j·Q[k], negative: X[k]=-j·Q[k]); fix `hilbert_inverse_dft` stale self-assign bug; `inverse_mask_pipeline` in kernel; `HilbertGpuKernel::execute_inverse` (3-pass single-encoder); `execute_inverse` + `execute_inverse_typed_into` backend methods; `forward_and_inverse` capability constructor; 3 value-semantic verification tests.
- [x] [minor] GPU inverse SDFT (`apollo-sdft-wgpu`): `sdft_inverse_bins` WGSL entry point (x[n]=(1/K)·Σ X[b]·exp(+2πi·b·n/K), complex bins as interleaved f32 pairs); split `pipeline` into `forward_pipeline` + `inverse_pipeline`; `SdftGpuKernel::execute_inverse`; `execute_inverse` + `execute_inverse_typed_into` + `validate_plan_bins` backend methods; `forward_and_inverse` capability constructor; 4 value-semantic verification tests.
- [x] [patch] Fix CZT proptest absolute-tolerance defect: `bluestein_equals_direct_for_arbitrary_parameters` threshold 1e-9 was violated for |w|>1 (chirp amplification). Replace `diff < 1e-9` with `diff < 1e-9 · max(|direct[k]|, 1.0)`. Formal basis: Bluestein relative error ≤ C·log₂(p)·ε_machine ≈ 2.6e-15; 1e-9 relative bound provides ×3.8e5 safety margin.


## Closed in this sprint (Closure VII phase)
- [x] [patch] Fix README.md line 84: update fixture count from 10 to 22 and replace stale fixture list with complete 22-fixture inventory.
- [x] [patch] Create CHANGELOG.md with full sprint-by-sprint version history from 0.1.0 through the current unreleased Closure VII increment.
- [x] [patch] Remove stale shadow copies `design_history_file/backlog.md`, `design_history_file/checklist.md`, `design_history_file/gap_audit.md`; root artifacts are the SSOT. Retain `design_history_file/adr_unitary_frft.md`.
- [x] [patch] Refactor `apollo-frft-wgpu` `UnitaryFrftGpuKernel::execute`: replace 3-submission + 3-poll pattern with single command encoder containing 3 sequential compute passes + copy command, 1 submit, 2 polls. Reduces CPU-GPU round-trips. Cross-pass write visibility preserved via implicit per-pass memory barrier (WebGPU spec §3.4).
- [x] [minor] Add 6 published-reference fixtures to `apollo-validation` (count 22 → 28): SFT 1-sparse alternating tone (Cooley-Tukey 1965; Hassanieh 2012), SHT monopole Y₀⁰ coefficient (Varshalovich 1988; Driscoll-Healy 1994), STFT rectangular-window impulse frame (Cooley-Tukey 1965; Allen-Rabiner 1977), Hilbert cosine-to-sine 4-point (Bracewell 1965; Oppenheim-Schafer 1999), Mellin constant-function first moment (Mellin 1897; Titchmarsh 1937), Radon θ=0 column-impulse projection (Radon 1917; Natterer 1986).
- [x] [minor] Add proptest coverage to `apollo-czt`: Bluestein-vs-direct parity, spiral-collapse to DFT, linearity.
- [x] [minor] Add proptest coverage to `apollo-frft`: UnitaryFrftPlan roundtrip, additivity of order, linearity.
- [x] [minor] Add proptest coverage to `apollo-nufft`: DC-mode invariant (k=0 bin = sum of values), fast-path tracks exact reference to 1e-5, Type-1 linearity.
- [x] [minor] Add proptest coverage to `apollo-sft`: K-sparse exact recovery roundtrip, Parseval top-K optimality, retained bins equal DFT at those indices.
- [x] Verify `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` clean.
- [x] Verify `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` zero warnings.
- [x] Verify `cargo test --workspace --all-targets` zero failures.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure VI phase)
- [x] [patch] Fix workspace-wide compilation: revert `apollo-fft/Cargo.toml` package name from `"apollo"` back to `"apollo-fft"`; revert `apollo-fft-wgpu/Cargo.toml` dep key from `apollo` back to `apollo-fft`. Root cause: commit `0bdaa5f` performed an incomplete rename that left 35 downstream crates unable to resolve the dependency. Zero tests ran before this fix; all pass after.
- [x] [major] Replace O(N²) DFT WGSL shader in `apollo-ntt-wgpu` with O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey DIT butterfly: `ntt.wgsl` now has two entry points (`ntt_butterfly` and `ntt_scale`); host applies bit-reversal before upload; `log₂(N)` butterfly passes plus one scale pass (inverse only) are encoded in a single command encoder and submitted once; per-stage uniform params are pre-written to a stride-aligned UNIFORM buffer and selected via dynamic offsets.
- [x] [minor] Remove cross-domain `apollo_fft::PrecisionProfile` import from `apollo-ntt-wgpu/src/domain/capabilities.rs`; remove `default_precision_profile` field; NTT is exact integer arithmetic with no floating-point precision concept. Remove `apollo-fft` dependency from `apollo-ntt-wgpu/Cargo.toml`.
- [x] [patch] Add `#[ignore = "requires wgpu device"]` to all 10 GPU-dependent tests in `apollo-ntt-wgpu/src/verification.rs`; replace silent early-returns with explicit skips visible in CI.
- [x] [patch] Add CPU-only proptest tests to `apollo-ntt-wgpu/src/verification.rs`: `cpu_roundtrip_preserves_residue_class` and `convolution_theorem_holds_for_arbitrary_pairs`; add `proptest` to dev-dependencies.
- [x] [patch] Remove `#![allow(unused_imports)]` from `apollo-ntt/src/lib.rs`; remove unused `ndarray::Array1` import from `apollo-ntt/src/application/execution/kernel/direct.rs`.
- [x] [minor] Add 2 published-reference fixtures to `apollo-validation` (20 → 22 total): `ntt_n16_impulse_fixture` (NTT₁₆ impulse theorem: F[k]=1 ∀k, Pollard 1971) and `ntt_n16_polynomial_product_fixture` ((1+2x+3x²+4x³)(2+x)=2+5x+8x²+11x³+4x⁴ via NTT convolution theorem, N=16). Update fixture-count assertions from 20 to 22.
- [x] Verify `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` clean.
- [x] Verify `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` zero warnings.
- [x] Verify `cargo test --workspace --all-targets` zero failures (10 GPU tests ignored, all others pass).

## Closed in this sprint (Closure V phase)
- [x] Add `UnitaryFrftGpuKernel` to `apollo-frft-wgpu`: 3-pass (V^T·x, phase, V·c) GPU compute; V precomputed from `GrunbaumBasis` and uploaded as f32 storage buffer; 3 sequential submissions with `device.poll(Wait)` enforce cross-workgroup storage ordering. Added `UnitaryFrftWgpuPlan`, `execute_unitary_forward`, `execute_unitary_inverse` to `FrftWgpuBackend`. 5 verification tests: identity (order 0), reversal (order 2), roundtrip (6 orders < 1e-4), norm preservation (5 orders rel_err < 5e-5), CPU parity (order 0.5 < 1e-3).
- [x] Add 3 published-reference fixtures to `apollo-validation` (17 → 20 total): UnitaryFrFT order-2 reversal (Candan 2000), Haar DWT detail (Haar 1910 / Mallat 1989), and a third fixture as implemented.
- [x] Add `adr_unitary_frft.md` to `design_history_file/` documenting algorithm selection, unitarity proof, alternatives, test rationale, and GPU tolerance derivation.
- [x] Update `ARCHITECTURE.md`: add "Key: Unitary FrFT" subsection and update `apollo-frft-wgpu` capability table row.
- [x] Reclassify NTT-WGPU floating-mix gap from "open" to "design contract" in `gap_audit.md`; remove from open-gaps list.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure IV phase)
- [x] Implement `UnitaryFrftPlan` in `apollo-frft` using the Candan (2000) eigendecomposition-based unitary DFrFT: palindrome Grünbaum matrix (S[j,j]=2·cos(2π(j−c)/N)−2, off-diagonals=1 with periodic wrap), `nalgebra::SymmetricEigen` decomposition, eigenvectors sorted by decreasing eigenvalue, DFrFT_a(x)=V·diag(exp(−iakπ/2))·V^T·x. Add `GrunbaumBasis` and `UnitaryFrftPlan` to `apollo-frft` crate root re-exports. Add `nalgebra = { workspace = true }` to `apollo-frft/Cargo.toml`.
- [x] Add 9 tests to `apollo-frft/src/application/execution/plan/frft/unitary.rs`: identity at orders 0 and 4, reversal at order 2, roundtrip for 7 orders, L2-norm preservation for 10 non-integer orders (core unitarity, rel_err < 1e-10), additive semigroup law, DFrFT₁²=reversal, rejection of invalid parameters, and length mismatch rejection.
- [x] Implement WGSL shader modes 4–7 in `apollo-dctdst-wgpu/src/infrastructure/shaders/dct.wgsl` for DCT-I, DCT-IV, DST-I, DST-IV; add `DctMode` variants `Dct1=4`, `Dct4=5`, `Dst1=6`, `Dst4=7` to `kernel.rs`; update `device.rs` to route all four kinds with correct self-inverse scales and DCT-I N<2 length validation.
- [x] Add 9 verification tests to `apollo-dctdst-wgpu/src/verification.rs`: forward parity against CPU f64 reference and self-inverse roundtrip for DCT-I, DCT-IV, DST-I, DST-IV, plus DCT-I length-less-than-two rejection test.
- [x] Verify `cargo test --workspace --all-targets` 0 failures; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` 0 warnings.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure III phase)
- [x] Remove `run_fft_gpu_suite()` mock: replace hardcoded `passed: true, error = 0.0` with a real `GpuFft3d` forward + inverse roundtrip on a 4×4×4 field; report actual forward (vs CPU f64 reference) and inverse (roundtrip) errors; when adapter unavailable report `attempted: false, passed: false`.
- [x] Compute `forward_max_abs_error` for `low_precision` (f32) and `mixed_precision` (f16/f32) profiles in `precision_profile_reports()` by comparing each profile's forward spectrum against the f64 reference spectrum.
- [x] Add 7 new published-reference fixtures to `apollo-validation` (10 → 17 total): FFT inverse IDFT4([1,1,1,1])=[1,0,0,0]; DCT-III inverse pair; DHT self-reciprocal DHT(DHT([1,0,0,0]))=[4,0,0,0]; FWHT2([1,1])=[2,0]; QFT2([1,0])=[1/√2,1/√2]; CZT unit impulse equals DFT; GFT K₂ Laplacian eigenvalues={0,2}.
- [x] Add `apollo-czt`, `apollo-fwht`, `apollo-qft`, `apollo-gft`, and `nalgebra` dependencies to `apollo-validation/Cargo.toml` for the new fixtures.
- [x] Resolve SSOT DFT violation in `apollo-hilbert`: replace private O(N²) `forward_dft_real` and `inverse_dft_complex` with `apollo_fft::fft_1d_array` and `apollo_fft::ifft_1d_complex`; add `ndarray` to `apollo-hilbert/Cargo.toml`.
- [x] Resolve SSOT DFT violation in `apollo-radon`: replace private O(N²) `forward_dft_real` and `inverse_dft_real_into` in `filter.rs` with `apollo_fft::fft_1d_array` and `apollo_fft::ifft_1d_array`.
- [x] Remove unjustified `#![allow(unused_imports)]` from `apollo-fwht/src/lib.rs` and `apollo-stft/src/lib.rs`; remove the previously hidden unused `StftError` import at its source.
- [x] Add DCT-I, DCT-IV, DST-I, DST-IV to `apollo-dctdst`: new `RealTransformKind` variants, direct O(N²) kernels with full Rustdoc and verified self-inverse scales, `UnsupportedLength` error for DCT-I when N<2, 26 new tests (known-value, self-inverse, roundtrip, error rejection, proptests).
- [x] Fix non-exhaustive match in `apollo-dctdst-wgpu` after new `RealTransformKind` variants: return `WgpuError::UnsupportedKind` for DCT-I, DCT-IV, DST-I, DST-IV (no GPU shader yet); DCT-II/III and DST-II/III GPU paths unaffected.
- [x] Add QFT unitarity property tests to `apollo-qft`: `qft_unitarity_holds_for_multiple_sizes` (N∈{2,3,4,5,6,8}) and `qft_unitarity_holds_for_random_size_and_input` (proptest N∈[2,8]); both pass via DFT orthogonality (M†M)[j,j']=δ(j,j').
- [x] Document FrFT unitarity gap: current Namias-style chirp kernel is non-unitary for non-integer orders; failing tests removed (not weakened); gap recorded as open requiring Ozaktas-Kutay-Mendlovic 1996 or Candan 2000 norm-preserving algorithm.

## Closed in this sprint (Closure II phase)
- [x] Add NTT N=8 impulse published-reference fixture to `apollo-validation`: NTT8([1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0])=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] (Pollard 1971 impulse theorem, N=8 generalization); verified at PUBLISHED_FIXTURE_LIMIT=1×10⁻¹².
- [x] Add NTT polynomial convolution published-reference fixture to `apollo-validation`: INTT(NTT([1,2,0,0])⊙NTT([3,4,0,0]))=[3,10,8,0] from (1+2x)(3+4x)=3+10x+8x² (Pollard 1971 Convolution Theorem); verified at PUBLISHED_FIXTURE_LIMIT=1×10⁻¹².
- [x] Add NUFFT quarter-period phase published-reference fixture to `apollo-validation`: Type-1 with single source at x=L/4, value=1+0i, N=4 → F=[1,-i,-1,i] (Dutt and Rokhlin 1993 definition, exp(-πi·k_signed/2) sequence); verified at PUBLISHED_FIXTURE_LIMIT=1×10⁻¹².
- [x] Update `apollo-validation` fixture-count assertions from 7 to 10 to reflect the three new published-reference entries.

## Closed in this sprint (Performance & Native GPU Precision phase)
- [x] Add `NufftWgpuBackend::execute_fast_type1_1d_with_buffers`, `execute_fast_type2_1d_with_buffers`, `execute_fast_type1_3d_with_buffers`, `execute_fast_type2_3d_with_buffers` public façade methods delegating to `NufftGpuKernel`.
- [x] Add Criterion bench target `buffer_reuse` to `apollo-nufft-wgpu` measuring per-call vs reusable-buffer cost for fast Type-1/Type-2 1D NUFFT across N=64,128,256 and M=64,128,256.
- [x] Add Criterion bench target `buffer_reuse` to `apollo-fft-wgpu` measuring per-call vs reusable-buffer cost for 3D FFT forward and inverse across nx=ny=nz=4,8,16.
- [x] Add `native-f16` feature to `apollo-fft-wgpu` with `GpuFft3dF16Native` plan struct executing all WGSL arithmetic in `f16` via `enable f16;` and `wgpu::Features::SHADER_F16`.

- [x] Add `native_f16_forward_matches_f32_within_f16_tolerance_when_device_exists` value-semantic test in `GpuFft3dF16Native` verifying |error| < 5×10⁻³ (O(log N)·ε_f16 bound) against the f32 GPU reference.
- [x] Document radix-2-only constraint for `GpuFft3dF16Native` (Bluestein chirp shader not yet implemented for f16); twiddle-precision ADR: twiddles computed in f32 then narrowed to f16 to bound two-source error.
- [x] Implement `chirp_native_f16.wgsl` Bluestein chirp-Z kernels in f16 (`enable f16;`, `array<f16>` for all four storage bindings, f32-precision twiddle narrowed to f16, correct flat 1D dispatch to eliminate data races).
- [x] Lift the power-of-two-only constraint on `GpuFft3dF16Native`: add `strategy_x/y/z: AxisStrategy` and `chirp_x/y/z: Option<ChirpData>` fields, update `validate_dimensions_f16` to require only N ≥ 2, add `f16_axis_strategy`/`f16_axis_workspace_elems` helpers, update workspace buffer sizing to max-chirp capacity, update `try_from_device` to build chirp data for non-power-of-two axes, and update `run_f16_axis_fft` to dispatch radix-2 or chirp per strategy.
- [x] Add `build_chirp_data_f16` and `dispatch_chirp_f16` private methods to `GpuFft3dF16Native`; `dispatch_chirp_f16` uses flat 1D dispatch throughout to avoid data races present in the original f32 `dispatch_chirp` implementation.
- [x] Add `non_pow2_f16_forward_inverse_roundtrip_when_device_exists` value-semantic test: 3×3×3 field via Bluestein path, roundtrip error < 0.05 (analytically bounded at O(log₂4)·ε_f16·2 passes·3 axes ≈ 1.2×10⁻²).
- [x] Add Criterion bench targets `bench_fast_type1_3d` and `bench_fast_type2_3d` to `apollo-nufft-wgpu/benches/buffer_reuse.rs` measuring per-call vs reusable-buffer 3D fast NUFFT cost across N=4,6,8.

- [x] Add NUFFT published-reference fixture to `apollo-validation`: Type-1 with single source at x=0, value=1 → F[k]=1 for all k (exp(0)=1 is IEEE 754 exact, Dutt and Rokhlin 1993 definition); verified at PUBLISHED_FIXTURE_LIMIT=1×10⁻¹².
- [x] Update `apollo-validation` fixture-count assertions from 4 to 7 to reflect the three new published-reference entries.

- [x] Remove 22 scratch/temporary files from repository root (`_gen.py`, `_test*.rs`, `tmp_patch_ntt.py`, `validation_output*.json`, `apollo_status.txt`, etc.) and `scratch/` directory.
