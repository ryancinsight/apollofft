//! Spherical harmonic basis and Gauss-Legendre quadrature kernels.
//!
//! The complex spherical harmonic is
//! `Y_l^m(theta, phi) = N_lm P_l^m(cos(theta)) exp(i m phi)` for `m >= 0`,
//! with `Y_l^-m = (-1)^m conj(Y_l^m)`. `P_l^m` includes the
//! Condon-Shortley phase. The normalization constant is
//! `N_lm = sqrt((2l + 1)/(4pi) * (l - m)!/(l + m)!)`.
//!
//! # Theorem 1 — Bonnet's Recurrence for Associated Legendre Polynomials
//!
//! **Statement.** For fixed order `m >= 0` and degree `l > m + 1`:
//!
//! ```text
//! P_l^m(x) = ((2l - 1) x P_{l-1}^m(x) - (l + m - 1) P_{l-2}^m(x)) / (l - m)
//! ```
//!
//! **Seeds.**
//!
//! ```text
//! P_m^m(x)   = (-1)^m (2m - 1)!! (1 - x^2)^(m/2)   (Condon-Shortley seed)
//! P_{m+1}^m(x) = x (2m + 1) P_m^m(x)               (one-step bootstrap)
//! ```
//!
//! **Proof sketch.** The three-term recurrence follows directly from Bonnet's formula
//! `(l - m) P_l^m = (2l - 1) x P_{l-1}^m - (l + m - 1) P_{l-2}^m` applied at
//! fixed order `m`. The seed `P_m^m` arises by applying the Rodrigues formula
//! `P_l(x) = (1/(2^l l!)) d^l/dx^l (x^2 - 1)^l` and differentiating `m` times with
//! respect to the generating function, yielding the factor `(2m - 1)!! = 1 * 3 * 5 * ... * (2m-1)`.
//! The factor `(-1)^m` is the Condon-Shortley phase convention adopted throughout this
//! crate. Upward recurrence in `l` at fixed `m` is numerically stable: the physically
//! desired solution grows faster than any parasitic complement for increasing `l`.

//! # Theorem 2 — Gauss-Legendre Polynomial Exactness
//!
//! **Statement.** The `n`-point Gauss-Legendre rule integrates every polynomial `p` of
//! degree `<= 2n - 1` exactly on `[-1, 1]`:
//!
//! ```text
//! ∫_{-1}^{1} p(x) dx = Σ_{i=1}^{n} w_i p(x_i),   deg(p) <= 2n - 1
//! ```
//!
//! **Proof sketch.** The GL nodes `x_i` are the `n` distinct roots of the degree-`n`
//! Legendre polynomial `P_n(x)`. For any polynomial `p` with `deg(p) <= 2n - 1`,
//! write `p(x) = q(x) P_n(x) + r(x)` where `deg(q) <= n - 1` and `deg(r) <= n - 1`
//! (Euclidean division). Since `P_n` is `L^2`-orthogonal to all polynomials of degree
//! `< n`, one has `∫_{-1}^{1} q(x) P_n(x) dx = 0`. The interpolatory quadrature rule
//! based on `n` nodes integrates `r` (degree `<= n - 1`) exactly, and `q(x_i) P_n(x_i) = 0`
//! at every node because `x_i` is a root of `P_n`. Combining, the rule produces the
//! exact value for all `p` of degree `<= 2n - 1`. The weights are given by
//! `w_i = 2 / ((1 - x_i^2)(P_n'(x_i))^2) > 0` and can be computed from the Golub-Welsch
//! eigenproblem for the symmetric tridiagonal Jacobi matrix of the Legendre three-term
//! recurrence.
//!
//! **Reference.** Golub & Welsch (1969), "Calculation of Gauss quadrature rules," Theorem 1.
//!
//! # Theorem 3 — Spherical Harmonic Orthonormality
//!
//! **Statement.** With solid-angle measure `dΩ = sin θ dθ dφ`:
//!
//! ```text
//! ∫_{S²} Y_l^m(Ω) conj(Y_{l'}^{m'}(Ω)) dΩ = δ_{l,l'} δ_{m,m'}
//! ```
//!
//! **Proof sketch.**
//!
//! 1. *Longitude integral.* The azimuthal factors contribute
//!    `∫_0^{2π} exp(i(m - m')φ) dφ = 2π δ_{m,m'}`. On a uniform longitude grid of
//!    `N_lon` points with spacing `Δφ = 2π / N_lon`, the discrete sum equals `2π δ_{m,m'}`
//!    exactly for all `|m - m'| < N_lon` (DFT orthogonality identity).
//!
//! 2. *Latitude integral.* After substituting `x = cos θ`, the latitude integral
//!    reduces to `N_lm N_{l'm} ∫_{-1}^{1} P_l^m(x) P_{l'}^m(x) dx`. The Legendre
//!    polynomial orthogonality theorem states
//!    `∫_{-1}^{1} P_l^m(x) P_{l'}^m(x) dx = 2(l+m)! / ((2l+1)(l-m)!) δ_{l,l'}`.
//!    With `N_lm^2 = (2l+1)(l-m)! / (4π(l+m)!)` (Theorem 5), the product is
//!    `N_lm^2 * 2(l+m)! / ((2l+1)(l-m)!) = 1/(2π)` times `δ_{l,l'}`.
//!
//! 3. *Combined.* Multiplying the longitude result `2π δ_{m,m'}` by the latitude
//!    result `(1/(2π)) δ_{l,l'}` yields `δ_{l,l'} δ_{m,m'}`. ∎
//!
//! **Reference.** Driscoll & Healy (1994), "Computing Fourier transforms and convolutions
//! on the 2-sphere," Theorem 1.
//!
//! # Theorem 4 — SHT Forward-Inverse Exactness
//!
//! **Statement.** Let `f` be band-limited to degree `<= L` (i.e., `f = Σ_{l<=L} Σ_m a_lm Y_l^m`
//! for finitely many coefficients). If the grid satisfies `L < N_lat` and `2L + 1 <= N_lon`,
//! then in exact arithmetic:
//!
//! ```text
//! inverse(forward(f)) = f
//! ```
//!
//! **Proof sketch.**
//!
//! - *Longitude exactness.* The uniform DFT on `N_lon >= 2L + 1` points recovers all
//!   Fourier modes `|m| <= L` without aliasing (Shannon-Nyquist criterion for integer
//!   frequencies; the maximum mode product `|m| + |m'| <= 2L < N_lon`).
//!
//! - *Latitude exactness.* For fixed `(l, m)`, the forward quadrature integrand
//!   `f(θ) conj(Y_l^m(θ))` is a polynomial of degree `<= 2L` in `cos θ` (product of
//!   two associated Legendre polynomials, each of degree `<= L` in `cos θ`). The
//!   `N_lat`-point GL rule is exact for polynomials of degree `<= 2 N_lat - 1 >= 2L`
//!   because `N_lat > L`, so `forward` recovers the true spectral coefficients `a_lm`.
//!
//! - *Reconstruction.* By Theorem 3, orthonormality holds exactly under the GL
//!   quadrature-based inner product (Theorem 2 guarantees the GL rule is exact for the
//!   degree-`2L` integrand). Linearity and the band-limitation `l <= L` complete the
//!   argument: `inverse(forward(f)) = Σ a_lm Y_l^m = f`.
//!
//! # Theorem 5 — Normalization Constant Derivation
//!
//! **Statement.** The constant
//!
//! ```text
//! N_lm = sqrt((2l + 1)/(4π) * (l - m)! / (l + m)!)
//! ```
//!
//! satisfies `∫_0^π (N_lm P_l^m(cos θ))^2 sin θ dθ = 1/(2π)`, so that the full
//! sphere integral `∫_{S²} |Y_l^m(Ω)|^2 dΩ = 1`.
//!
//! **Proof sketch.** Substituting `x = cos θ`, `dx = -sin θ dθ` transforms the integral to
//! `N_lm^2 ∫_{-1}^{1} (P_l^m(x))^2 dx`. The Legendre orthogonality integral evaluates to
//! `∫_{-1}^{1} (P_l^m(x))^2 dx = 2(l+m)! / ((2l+1)(l-m)!)` (standard result, e.g. A&S 8.14.11).
//! Multiplying:
//!
//! ```text
//! N_lm^2 * 2(l+m)!/((2l+1)(l-m)!)
//!   = (2l+1)(l-m)!/(4π(l+m)!) * 2(l+m)!/((2l+1)(l-m)!)
//!   = 2/(4π)
//!   = 1/(2π).
//! ```
//!
//! Including the azimuthal integral `∫_0^{2π} |exp(imφ)|^2 dφ = 2π` gives
//! `∫_{S²} |Y_l^m|^2 dΩ = 2π * (1/(2π)) = 1`. ∎
