#![warn(missing_docs)]
//! Discrete Radon transform and CT-style reconstruction plans for Apollo.
//!
//! The Radon transform maps a 2D image into projection lines indexed by angle
//! and detector coordinate. This crate defines a discrete image model where
//! each pixel value is a point mass located at its pixel center. Forward Radon
//! analysis deposits each mass onto detector bins with linear weights; adjoint
//! backprojection uses the same weights in reverse, preserving the inner-product
//! identity `<R f, p> = <f, R* p>`.
//!
//! Filtered backprojection applies a direct DFT ramp filter to each projection
//! before adjoint backprojection. This exposes the CT reconstruction primitive
//! while keeping the forward model, adjoint, and filter in one crate-owned
//! hierarchy.
