# Apollo CZT

`apollo-czt` owns the chirp z-transform implementation for Apollo.

## Architecture

```text
src/
  domain/          errors and validated contracts
  application/     reusable CZT plan and execution policy
  infrastructure/  CPU convenience transport
```

The application plan is the single source of truth for transform lengths,
spiral parameters, chirp factors, the convolution kernel, and the backing
Apollo FFT plan.

## Precision Contract

`forward_typed_into` supports:

- `HIGH_ACCURACY_F64`: `Complex64` storage.
- `LOW_PRECISION_F32`: `Complex32` storage.
- `MIXED_PRECISION_F16_F32`: `[f16; 2]` storage, where lane 0 is the real
  component and lane 1 is the imaginary component.

All typed paths reuse the authoritative `Complex64` Bluestein path and quantize
once at the storage boundary. Profile/storage mismatch is rejected with
`CztError::PrecisionMismatch`.

## Mathematical Contract

For input `x[0..n)`, output length `m`, and non-zero finite spiral parameters
`a` and `w`, the transform is

```text
X[k] = sum_n x[n] a^-n w^(n k)
```

`forward_direct` evaluates this definition directly in `O(nm)` time.
`forward` and `forward_into` use Bluestein's identity
`nk = (n^2 + k^2 - (k-n)^2) / 2` to reduce the transform to one zero-padded
convolution evaluated by `apollo-fft`.

## Inverse Transform

`CztPlan::inverse(spectrum)` inverts the square (M == N) CZT by solving the
Vandermonde system

```text
V y = X   where V[k,n] = W^(kn)
```

via the Björck-Pereyra algorithm (O(N²), in-place Newton divided-difference
phasors). After solving for `y`, the original signal is recovered as
`x[n] = y[n] · A^n`.

`CztError::NotInvertible` is returned when:
- the plan is non-square (M ≠ N), or
- a Vandermonde node denominator falls below `f64::EPSILON × 1024` (node
  collision — W is a root of unity of order ≤ N).

## Verification

The crate validates:

- direct and Bluestein paths agree on analytical complex inputs
- invalid lengths and mismatched execution buffers are rejected
- caller-owned output matches the allocating fast path
- typed `Complex64`, `Complex32`, and mixed `[f16; 2]` storage paths match the
  allocating fast path within analytically derived storage bounds
- inverse roundtrip at DFT parameters, general `A` offset, non-unit `W` spacing
- inverse rejects non-square plans and wrong-length spectrum inputs

Production CZT code depends on Apollo-owned FFT kernels. External FFT engines
belong only in `apollo-validation`.
