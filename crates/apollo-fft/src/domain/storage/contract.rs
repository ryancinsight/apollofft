/// Zero-cost mutable FFT storage view over a rectangular complex matrix.
///
/// `row` identifies the point inside one short transform and `col` identifies
/// the independent transform instance. Six-step execution uses this as the
/// matrix coordinate `(n1, n2)` in a conceptual `N1 x N2` factorization of a
/// one-dimensional signal.
///
/// # Theorem: row-major coordinate bijection
///
/// Let `A` be a flat complex array of length `rows * cols`. The map
/// `phi(row, col) = row * cols + col` is a bijection from
/// `{0..rows} x {0..cols}` to `{0..rows * cols}`. Injectivity follows because
/// `row_a * cols + col_a = row_b * cols + col_b` implies equal quotients and
/// remainders under Euclidean division by `cols`. Surjectivity follows because
/// every flat index `k < rows * cols` has inverse `(k / cols, k % cols)`.
///
/// Therefore algorithms expressed against `(row, col)` read and write the same
/// mathematical samples as flat storage without allocating or copying.
///
/// # Contract
///
/// Implementations must map every valid `(row, col)` pair to one storage
/// element. `load_*` and `store` must not allocate.
