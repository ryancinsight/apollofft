//! Mixed-radix factorization and dispatch heuristics for the Cooley-Tukey pipeline.
//!
//! ## Mathematical foundation
//!
//! The Cooley-Tukey DIT algorithm requires N = ∏ rₖ where each rₖ is in the
//! supported radix set {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}. Since 4 = 2² and 8 = 2³, the
//! underlying prime support is {2, 3, 5, 7}.
//!
//! A size N is **composite-smooth** if N = 2^a·3^b·5^c·7^d with not all
//! of b, c, d equal to zero. Pure powers of two are routed to the more
//! optimised Stockham kernels before composite factorization.
//!
//! ### Radix ordering (innermost first)
//!
//! Odd prime radices {7, 5, 3} are placed at the innermost stages, with
//! powers of two {8, 4, 2} at the outermost, to minimise the working-set
//! footprint during early stride-N/r passes (Van Loan 1992, §3.4).
//!

/// Factorize `n` into a radix sequence for the mixed-radix Cooley-Tukey DIT
/// algorithm, or return `None` if `n` has a prime factor outside {2, 3, 5, 7}.
///
/// ## Mathematical contract
///
/// **Theorem (factorization)**: Every positive integer has a unique prime
/// factorization. For n with all primes in {2, 3, 5, 7} this function returns
/// a factorization into Apollo's radix set {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}.
///
/// **Proof sketch**: Divide out all factors of 2, 3, 5, 7. If `remaining > 1`
/// after exhaustion, n has an unsupported prime → return `None`. Pack count2
/// greedily into groups of 3 → radix-8, remainder pair → radix-4, singleton
/// → radix-2. Product of returned radices equals n by construction. □
///
/// ## Complexity
///
/// O(log n) time; O(log n) space for the returned `Vec`.
///
/// ## Failure modes
///
/// Returns `None` when n has an unsupported prime factor or is a pure power
/// of two (handled by the Stockham power-of-two path).

/// Empirical Bluestein fallback heuristic for composite sizes with poor cache behaviour.
///
/// ## Heuristic criterion
///
/// For n ∈ [500, 2000], count leading (innermost) DFT-5 stages produced by
/// `factorize_composite`. If ≥ 3 consecutive DFT-5 stages are present, the
/// working set of the first stage is only `prev_len = 1` element — each
/// butterfly processes 5 scalars in isolation, producing poor cache utilization.
/// Bluestein pads to the nearest power of two and uses the vectorized
/// radix-8/Stockham kernel, which is substantially faster for these sizes.
///
/// ## Correctness boundary
///
/// - N=500 = 2²·5³: three DFT-5 innermost stages; triggers heuristic.
/// - N=1000 = 2³·5³: three DFT-5 innermost stages; triggers heuristic.
/// - N=2000 = 2⁴·5³: three DFT-5 innermost stages; triggers heuristic.
/// - N=4000 = 2⁵·5³: outside range [500,2000]; Rayon parallelism recovers perf.
///
/// ## Failure modes
///
/// A false positive routes a composite size through Bluestein (correct, slower
/// worst-case). A false negative uses composite (correct, potentially slower
/// than Bluestein for the affected sizes). Both failure modes produce correct output.
