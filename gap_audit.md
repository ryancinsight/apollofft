# Apollo Gap Audit

## Open Gaps

- `GpuFft3dF16Native` Bluestein path on production hardware with non-power-of-two sizes: current test passes on dev hardware; production validation on adapters that expose `wgpu::Features::SHADER_F16` is pending.
- Criterion buffer-reuse bench results on representative GPU hardware: allocation-vs-reuse speedup ratios for FFT/NUFFT/STFT/Radon WGPU benchmark suites are not yet recorded as numbers. Closure XXII added the manual self-hosted GPU workflow and runner script; the residual gap is the first benchmark execution on real labeled hardware and publication of the measured ratios.
- **NUFFT 2D CPU**: `apollo-nufft` has 1D and 3D; 2D separable NUFFT not yet implemented.
- **DWT 2D CPU**: `apollo-wavelet` has 1D DWT; 2D separable DWT not yet implemented.
- **GPU FFT 1D/2D**: `apollo-fft-wgpu` exposes 3D GPU FFT; 1D and 2D GPU FFT paths are absent.
- **FrFT 2D/3D**: `apollo-frft` has 1D only; 2D/3D separable fractional Fourier transform absent.
- **Hilbert inverse**: `apollo-hilbert` has 1D forward only; inverse (env. recovery) absent.
- **NTT 2D/3D**: `apollo-ntt` has 1D only; 2D/3D separable NTT absent.
- **STFT 2D**: `apollo-stft` / `apollo-stft-wgpu` are 1D only; 2D short-time FFT absent.
- **Mellin 2D/3D**: `apollo-mellin` has 1D only; 2D/3D separable Mellin transform absent.
- **SDFT inverse**: `apollo-sdft` and `apollo-sdft-wgpu` have forward only; inverse SDFT absent.
- **SFT 2D/3D**: `apollo-sft` has 1D only; 2D/3D SFT absent.
- **GFT 2D/3D**: `apollo-gft` has 1D only; 2D/3D GFT absent.
- **QFT 2D/3D**: `apollo-qft` has 1D only; 2D/3D QFT absent.
- **CZT 2D/3D**: `apollo-czt` has 1D only; 2D/3D CZT absent.
- **SHT 3D / Radon 3D**: `apollo-sht` has 2D only; `apollo-radon` has 2D only.

Note: NTT-WGPU floating mixed precision is an architectural design contract, not a gap.
Residue-field arithmetic requires exact modular integers; the WGPU surface uses exact `u32`
quantized storage (implemented and verified). Floating-point NTT is architecturally unsupported
by design and will not be implemented.

## Closed Gaps
### Closure LV - Apollo-Hilbert Caller-Owned Observable Projections [minor]
- **Gap**: `AnalyticSignal` projection methods allocated new vectors and
  duplicated projection formulas directly in each allocating method. Plan-level
  `envelope` and `phase` also forced an owned analytic signal allocation even
  when callers could provide output storage.
- **Closed by**: Added caller-owned `AnalyticSignal::*_into` projection
  methods, routed allocating projections through shared non-generic slice
  helpers, added `HilbertPlan::envelope_into` and `phase_into`, routed
  allocating plan observables through a reused per-thread Complex64 analytic
  scratch buffer, added parity/mismatch/capacity tests, updated the Hilbert
  README, and bumped `apollo-hilbert` to 0.3.0.
- **Residual risk**: Owned projection APIs still allocate their return vectors
  by contract. Callers that need allocation control should use the new
  caller-owned projection methods.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-hilbert`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert observables --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert envelope --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-validation`; `rg` source scans for removed projection duplication
  patterns.

### Closure LIV - Apollo-Hilbert Caller-Owned Analytic Signal [minor]
- **Gap**: `hilbert_transform_into` still allocated an owned analytic
  `Vec<Complex64>` on every caller-owned quadrature call, and callers had no
  public plan-level way to provide analytic output storage directly. The crate
  root documentation also still described private DFT ownership after Hilbert
  moved to Apollo FFT plan execution.
- **Closed by**: Added direct `analytic_signal_into`, added
  `HilbertPlan::analytic_signal_into`, routed owned analytic execution through
  the caller-owned kernel, routed caller-owned quadrature through a reused
  thread-local Complex64 analytic scratch buffer, added parity/mismatch/scratch
  capacity tests, updated README and crate-root docs, and bumped
  `apollo-hilbert` to 0.2.0.
- **Residual risk**: The owned `analytic_signal` API still allocates its
  returned `Vec<Complex64>` by contract. Caller-owned analytic and quadrature
  paths now avoid additional analytic bridge allocation.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-hilbert`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert analytic --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert workspace --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-validation`; `rg` source scans for removed caller-owned quadrature
  analytic allocation patterns.

### Closure LIII - Apollo FFT Slice Real Forward for Hilbert [minor]
- **Gap**: `apollo-hilbert` still built an `Array1<f64>` from every real input
  slice because `apollo-fft` exposed the optimized 1D real-forward owner path
  only through ndarray input. The existing ndarray caller-owned path also
  duplicated the real-forward implementation body instead of delegating to a
  slice-level owner routine.
- **Closed by**: Added
  `FftPlan1D::forward_real_to_complex_slice_into`, routed the existing ndarray
  caller-owned path through it, routed Hilbert analytic-signal execution through
  the cached FFT plan's slice path, removed the dead `ndarray` dependency from
  `apollo-hilbert`, split 1D precision methods and tests into leaf modules so
  `dimension_1d.rs` stays below 500 lines, added slice parity/rejection
  coverage, updated READMEs, bumped `apollo-fft` to 0.3.0, and bumped
  `apollo-hilbert` to 0.1.4.
- **Residual risk**: Hilbert still allocates its analytic `Vec<Complex64>`
  output per owning API call because the public `analytic_signal` contract
  returns owned storage. The caller-owned quadrature and typed bridge paths now
  avoid all additional input bridge arrays.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft
  caller_owned_paths --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft
  forward_slice --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib
  -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p apollo-hilbert`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-validation`; `rg` source scans for removed Hilbert ndarray
  bridge/dependency patterns.

### Closure LII - Apollo-Hilbert Analytic In-Place Spectrum Reuse [patch]
- **Gap**: `analytic_signal` copied the forward FFT output into a `Vec`,
  rebuilt an `Array1` from that vector, allocated a separate inverse FFT output
  array, and copied the inverse result back into another `Vec`. Owned
  quadrature also called the allocating analytic-signal path before projecting
  the imaginary component.
- **Closed by**: Kept the forward FFT output array as the analytic spectrum,
  applied the Hilbert mask in place, ran the complex inverse in place, moved the
  contiguous buffer out once for `analytic_signal`, routed `hilbert_transform`
  through `hilbert_transform_into`, updated the Hilbert README, and bumped
  `apollo-hilbert` to 0.1.3.
- **Residual risk**: The real input bridge `Array1<f64>` remains because
  `apollo_fft::fft_1d_array` is the current optimized real-forward API. Removing
  that allocation requires a slice-level real FFT entry point in `apollo-fft`.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-hilbert`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert transform --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-validation`; `rg` source scans for removed analytic-signal copy
  allocation patterns.

### Closure LI - Apollo-Hilbert Owner Quadrature Slice Kernel [patch]
- **Gap**: `HilbertPlan::transform_into` called the allocating
  `hilbert_transform` owner function and copied the returned quadrature vector
  into caller-owned output. `apollo-hilbert` also retained a direct `rayon`
  dependency after the private parallel O(N²) DFT kernels were removed.
- **Closed by**: Added `hilbert_transform_into` as the slice-level owner
  quadrature kernel, routed `HilbertPlan::transform_into` through it, kept typed
  execution on the same shared owner path, removed the unused direct `rayon`
  dependency, added direct kernel parity/mismatch tests, updated the Hilbert
  README, and bumped `apollo-hilbert` to 0.1.2.
- **Residual risk**: The analytic-signal owner kernel still allocates FFT input,
  spectrum, and analytic buffers because the current `apollo_fft` public array
  entry points own those conversions. That is the next bounded Hilbert memory
  target.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-hilbert`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert transform_into --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-validation`; `rg` source scans for removed copy-through allocation and
  dead direct dependency.

### Closure L - Apollo-Hilbert Typed Workspace Reuse [patch]
- **Gap**: `HilbertPlan::analytic_signal_typed` and
  `transform_typed_into` allocated f64 bridge vectors on every reduced-storage
  call before entering the shared owner Hilbert implementation.
- **Closed by**: Added thread-local f64 input and output workspaces for typed
  Hilbert execution, preserved the `f64` zero-copy specialization, routed
  reduced-storage execution through the existing analytic-mask owner path, added
  repeated-call f32 capacity/value coverage, updated the Hilbert README, and
  bumped `apollo-hilbert` to 0.1.1.
- **Residual risk**: Typed Hilbert scratch is retained per thread at the
  largest signal length executed by that thread. Recursive same-thread typed
  Hilbert calls are rejected by `RefCell` borrow checking.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-hilbert`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert workspace --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-validation`; `rg` source scan for removed Hilbert production typed
  bridge allocation patterns.

### Closure XLIX - Apollo-SDFT Typed Workspace Reuse [patch]
- **Gap**: `SdftPlan::direct_bins_typed_into` allocated an f64 input bridge
  vector and Complex64 output bridge vector on every typed direct-bin call
  before entering the owner direct-bin kernel.
- **Closed by**: Added thread-local f64/Complex64 direct-bin workspaces,
  routed typed direct-bin execution through the shared owner kernel without
  per-call bridge allocation, added repeated-call f32 capacity/value coverage,
  updated the SDFT README, and bumped `apollo-sdft` to 0.1.1.
- **Residual risk**: Typed direct-bin scratch is retained per thread at the
  largest window length and bin count executed by that thread. Recursive
  same-thread typed direct-bin calls are rejected by `RefCell` borrow checking.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-sdft`; `cargo test -p apollo-sdft
  workspace --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-sdft --lib --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p apollo-validation`; `rg` source scan for
  removed SDFT production typed bridge allocation patterns.

### Closure XLVIII - Apollo-STFT Inverse WOLA Workspace Reuse [patch]
- **Gap**: The STFT inverse owner path allocated four work buffers per call:
  frame-domain samples, complex frame FFT input, overlap accumulation, and
  squared-window weight accumulation. The typed inverse path inherited the same
  allocations through the shared owner inverse kernel.
- **Closed by**: Added thread-local WOLA workspaces for frame, complex,
  overlap, and weight buffers; routed `inverse_into`, `inverse`, and typed
  inverse through the same slice-level owner path; zeroed only accumulation
  buffers before WOLA; added repeated-call value/capacity reuse coverage;
  updated the STFT ADR and README; and bumped `apollo-stft` to 0.2.1.
- **Residual risk**: Inverse WOLA scratch is retained per thread at the largest
  frame work length and signal length executed by that thread. Recursive
  same-thread inverse calls are rejected by `RefCell` borrow checking.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-stft`; `cargo test -p apollo-stft
  workspace --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-stft --lib --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p apollo-validation`; `rg` source scan for
  removed STFT production inverse WOLA allocation patterns.

### Closure XLVII - Apollo-STFT Typed Workspace Reuse and Alias Removal [major]
- **Gap**: `StftPlan::forward_typed_into` and `inverse_typed_into` allocated
  owner-precision `Array1` bridge buffers per call before entering the f64 /
  Complex64 owner path. `forward_inplace` and `inverse_inplace` were
  deprecated allocating aliases, and `dimension_1d.rs` exceeded the structural
  file-size limit.
- **Closed by**: Added slice-level f64/Complex64 execution entry points,
  reused thread-local typed bridge workspaces, moved storage/profile traits to
  `stft::storage`, moved tests into a leaf module, added a co-located ADR,
  removed the deprecated alias methods and README references, added
  repeated-call f32 workspace reuse coverage, and bumped `apollo-stft` to 0.2.0.
- **Residual risk**: Typed scratch is retained per thread at the largest STFT
  signal and spectrum dimensions executed by that thread. The inverse owner
  WOLA allocation gap was closed in Closure XLVIII.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-stft`; `cargo test -p apollo-stft
  workspace --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-stft --lib --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p apollo-validation`; `rg` source scan for
  removed STFT production typed bridge allocation and deprecated alias
  patterns.

### Closure XLVI - Apollo-QFT Dense and Typed Workspace Reuse [patch]
- **Gap**: `QftPlan::forward_into` and `inverse_into` allocated a dense
  transform vector before copying into caller-owned output, and typed QFT paths
  allocated Complex64 input/output bridge arrays per call.
- **Closed by**: Added dense `*_into` kernels, routed plan execution through
  Complex64 slices, reused thread-local Complex64 typed bridge workspaces,
  added repeated-call complex32 forward/inverse workspace reuse coverage, and
  bumped `apollo-qft` to 0.1.1.
- **Residual risk**: Typed scratch is retained per thread at the largest QFT
  dimension executed by that thread. The intentionally allocating convenience
  dense wrappers remain for callers that request owned `Vec` output.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-qft`; `cargo test -p apollo-qft
  workspace --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-qft --lib --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p apollo-validation`; `rg` scan for removed
  QFT production plan/typed allocation patterns.

### Closure XLV - Apollo-GFT Typed Workspace Reuse [patch]
- **Gap**: GFT typed storage paths allocated f64 input/output bridge arrays
  per forward and inverse call before invoking the owner graph-basis multiply.
- **Closed by**: Added contiguous f64 slice execution on `GftPlan`, reused
  thread-local f64 input/output workspaces for typed storage, added
  repeated-call f32 forward/inverse workspace reuse coverage, and bumped
  `apollo-gft` to 0.1.1.
- **Residual risk**: Typed scratch is retained per thread at the largest graph
  order executed by that thread. This replaces repeated allocation with
  bounded reuse.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-gft`; `cargo test -p apollo-gft
  workspace --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-gft --lib --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p apollo-validation`; `rg` scan for removed
  GFT production typed bridge allocation patterns.

### Closure XLIV - Apollo-FWHT Typed Workspace Reuse [patch]
- **Gap**: FWHT typed storage defaults allocated f64 input/output bridge
  arrays per call, and mixed f16 FWHT allocated a fresh f32 compute vector per
  forward/inverse call.
- **Closed by**: Added contiguous f64 slice execution on `FwhtPlan`, reused
  thread-local f64 bridge workspaces for default typed storage, reused a
  thread-local f32 compute workspace for mixed f16 storage, added repeated-call
  workspace reuse coverage, and bumped `apollo-fwht` to 0.1.1.
- **Residual risk**: Typed scratch is retained per thread at the largest FWHT
  length executed by that thread. This replaces repeated allocation with
  bounded reuse.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fwht`; `cargo test -p apollo-fwht
  workspace --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-fwht --lib --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p apollo-validation`; `rg` scan for removed
  FWHT production typed bridge allocation patterns.

### Closure XLIII - Apollo-CZT Workspace Reuse and FFT Warning Cleanup [patch]
- **Gap**: `CztPlan` allocated a fresh Complex64 Bluestein convolution
  workspace on every plan-path forward call, typed CZT paths allocated
  Complex64 bridge arrays for forward/inverse, inverse CZT rebuilt
  Vandermonde nodes per call, and `apollo-fft` still retained unused radix-2
  butterfly helpers after Stockham became canonical.
- **Closed by**: Added plan-owned convolution scratch, added CZT slice
  execution, precomputed square-plan inverse nodes, reused thread-local typed
  bridge workspaces, removed dead radix-2 helper code, added missing
  `FftPlan3D` Rustdoc, and bumped `apollo-czt` to 0.2.1 plus `apollo-fft` to
  0.2.2.
- **Residual risk**: CZT forward scratch is retained per plan at
  `convolution_len`; typed bridge scratch is retained per thread at the
  largest typed CZT input/output dimensions used on that thread. This replaces
  repeated allocation with bounded reuse.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-czt`; `cargo test -p apollo-czt workspace --lib -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-czt --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-fft radix2 --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-czt-wgpu -p apollo-validation`; `rg` scans for deleted CZT typed
  bridge allocation patterns and removed radix-2 helper names.

### Closure XLII - Apollo-FFT Dead Helper Cleanup [patch]
- **Gap**: Current `apollo-fft` kernel sources retained unused helper
  implementations after the power-of-two path moved to Stockham/composite
  routing: f16 with-twiddles bridge allocation, uniform power-of-two
  digit-reversal helpers, power-of-four/eight shape predicates, and unused
  Winograd stage traits.
- **Closed by**: Removed the dead helpers and their stale tests/docs while
  retaining the live bit-reversal primitive for radix-2 and mixed-radix
  permutation for composite FFT routing.
- **Residual risk**: None identified for the removed items; the final source
  scan reports no references to the deleted helper names.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft
  radix_shape --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft
  radix_permute --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `rg` scan for the deleted helper
  names.

### Closure XLII - Apollo-FRFT Typed Workspace Reuse [patch]
- **Gap**: `FrftStorage` typed paths for `Complex32` and `[f16; 2]` allocated
  one Complex64 input array and one Complex64 output array per call before
  invoking the direct FrFT implementation.
- **Closed by**: Added internal Complex64 slice entry points on `FrftPlan`,
  replaced typed bridge arrays with thread-local reusable input/output
  workspaces, added a repeated-call workspace reuse regression test, restored
  the current `apollo-fft` module/import drift that blocked dependency
  compilation, and bumped `apollo-frft` to 0.1.2 plus `apollo-fft` to 0.2.1.
- **Residual risk**: Typed scratch is retained per thread at the largest typed
  FrFT length executed on that thread. This is the same bounded reuse tradeoff
  as the unitary workspace cleanup.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-frft`; `cargo test -p apollo-frft typed
  --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-frft --lib --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p apollo-frft-wgpu -p apollo-validation`;
  `rg` scan for removed typed bridge `Array1::from_iter` / `output64`
  allocation patterns.

### Closure XLII - Apollo-FRFT Unitary Workspace Reuse [patch]
- **Gap**: `UnitaryFrftPlan` allocated a fresh O(N) coefficient vector on every
  forward and inverse execution even though the Candan-Grünbaum algorithm only
  requires one temporary coefficient workspace per executing thread.
- **Closed by**: Added thread-local reusable coefficient scratch for the
  projection, phase, and reconstruction steps, added a regression test for
  capacity reuse and output equality, removed stale backward-compatibility
  wording from live crate-root exports, and bumped `apollo-frft` to 0.1.1.
- **Residual risk**: Scratch is retained per thread at the largest unitary FrFT
  length executed on that thread. This trades repeated heap allocation for
  bounded thread-local reuse.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-frft`; `cargo test -p apollo-frft
  unitary --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-frft --lib --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p apollo-frft-wgpu -p apollo-validation`;
  `rg` scan for stale FrFT compatibility/deprecated markers and the removed
  `vec![Complex64::new(0.0, 0.0); n]` allocation.

### Closure XLII - Apollo-FFT Compatibility Re-Export Cleanup [major]
- **Gap**: `apollo-fft` retained compatibility re-export modules and a legacy
  `FFT_CACHE` alias after root exports already exposed the canonical public
  names. It also retained unused power-of-four/eight forwarding modules under
  `infrastructure::cpu::simd::power_of_two` that duplicated radix-2 execution.
- **Closed by**: Removed the compatibility modules, removed `FFT_CACHE`, deleted
  the unused forwarding modules, updated in-repo callers to root or canonical
  paths, fixed a test-only `Complex32/64` import gap surfaced by the full test
  build, and bumped `apollo-fft` to 0.2.0.
- **Residual risk**: External callers using the removed compatibility paths must
  migrate to root exports or canonical owner modules. This is an intentional
  pre-1.0 breaking cleanup.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-fft-wgpu -p apollo-czt -p apollo-nufft -p apollo-stft -p apollo-sft`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-fft --benches`; `rg` scan for removed compatibility paths and legacy
  aliases in touched crate sources.

### Closure XLII - STFT-WGPU Deprecated Error and Retained-Resource Cleanup [major]
- **Gap**: `apollo-stft-wgpu` retained a deprecated
  `WgpuError::FrameLenNotPowerOfTwo` public variant after Chirp-Z support made
  non-power-of-two frame lengths valid, and retained GPU resources used explicit
  dead-code suppressions.
- **Closed by**: Removed the stale error variant, strengthened non-power-of-two
  tests to require successful Chirp-Z execution/buffer construction, renamed
  retained GPU resource fields with `_` ownership names, and bumped
  `apollo-stft-wgpu` to 0.11.0. Removed the remaining NUFFT/NTT WGPU
  dead-code suppressions by enforcing NUFFT reusable-buffer sample capacity
  before GPU writes, replacing NUFFT per-dispatch layout-placeholder allocations
  with one retained layout padding buffer, deleting duplicated NTT scalar
  `n_inv` storage, and keeping retained NTT GPU resources as explicit `_` owner
  fields.
- **Residual risk**: GPU-gated execution remains dependent on adapter
  availability; tests skip only when no WGPU device can be acquired.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-stft-wgpu`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-stft-wgpu --lib -- --test-threads=1`; matching `cargo check` and
  `cargo test --lib` for `apollo-nufft-wgpu` and `apollo-ntt-wgpu`; `rg` scans
  for `FrameLenNotPowerOfTwo`, `#[allow(dead_code)]`, deprecated markers, and
  NUFFT placeholder buffers in the audited WGPU crate sources.

### Closure XLII - DCT/DST Fast-Path Unused Output Allocation Cleanup [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-dctdst` single-output DCT-II and DST-II fast paths allocated
  an N-length sibling output only to call the dual DCT/DST projection kernel.
- **Closed by**: Factored the shared 2N-point FFT setup and projection-fill
  helpers so `dct2_fast` fills only DCT-II and `dst2_fast` fills only DST-II,
  while `dct2_dst2_fast` still computes both projections from one FFT.
- **Residual risk**: The fast path still allocates the required 2N complex FFT
  buffer and FFT output; this increment removes only the provably unused
  real-output allocation.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-dctdst`; focused fast-path regression
  test comparing single-projection outputs to the dual kernel and direct
  analytical DCT-II/DST-II kernels; full `cargo test -p apollo-dctdst --lib
  -- --test-threads=1`.

### Closure XLII — Apollo vs RustFFT f32 N=4096 Performance Disparity [patch]
- **Gap**: Apollo f32 N=4096 throughput remains behind RustFFT; prior evidence
  depended on a plan-scratch benchmark route that is absent from the current
  checkout API surface.
- **Closed by**: Rejected the candidate that disabled the f32 N=4096 radix-16
  quad suffix after same-session Criterion measured Apollo 6.5098 µs vs RustFFT
  3.7433 µs. Restored the local `vs_rustfft` benchmark to compile against the
  present API with a local RustFFT dev-dependency and current mixed-radix
  precomputed-twiddle calls.
- **Residual risk**: Current f32 N=4096 precomputed-twiddle row measures Apollo
  22.790 µs vs RustFFT 3.5969 µs. This indicates API/dispatch drift, not a
  retained Stockham codelet improvement, and is not comparable to the prior
  plan-scratch row.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft
  dft7 --lib -- --test-threads=1`; focused Criterion f32 N=4096 Apollo/RustFFT
  precomputed-twiddle and quad-disabled probes.
- **Follow-up increment**: Large f32 power-of-two dispatch now uses the
  monomorphized Stockham scratch-backed kernel with thread-local scratch,
  eliminating the prior radix-8 facade route. Final retained f32 N=4096
  Criterion measured Apollo zero-alloc reused 7.0463 µs, Apollo caller-twiddle
  reused 8.9737 µs, and RustFFT reused 6.2814 µs. The initial production 8x512
  hybrid and direct no-argument micro-dispatch probes were rejected because
  they regressed the then-retained route.
- **Current residual**: The f32 N=4096 retained schedule now disables the
  spilling quad suffix while preserving stride-64 triple suppression, then uses
  a single-entry thread-local f32 forward-twiddle fast cache for the public path.
  Longer Criterion measured Apollo zero-alloc reused 6.3347 µs, Apollo
  caller-twiddle reused 6.0315 µs, and RustFFT reused 4.2974 µs. The remaining
  gap is in the Stockham f32 N=4096 memory traffic/kernel body, not hot-path
  allocation or `Arc` cloning.
- **Correctness correction**: The terminal groups=1 in-place Stockham hook was
  removed after audit because the source layout is interleaved
  (`src[2j]`, `src[2j+1]`) and a direct in-place final stage overwrites future
  inputs. Static N=4096 f32 twiddle specialization, direct concrete benchmark
  calls, shortened public branching, zero-copy generic schedule flipping, and
  split public scratch/twiddle caching were all rejected by focused Criterion
  probes.
- **Current retained result**: The verified f32 8x512 helper remains test-only
  after same-tree Criterion showed the generic Stockham route was faster. The
  retained f32 N=4096 path uses the radix-8/radix-8 tail schedule and split
  public scratch/twiddle caches; the dead combined workspace was removed.
  Final current-tree Criterion measured Apollo public zero-alloc reused
  5.4298 µs, Apollo caller-twiddle reused 5.2661 µs, and RustFFT reused
  3.6958 µs. Earlier same-state retained measurement reached Apollo public
  4.8645 µs and caller-twiddle 4.7913 µs. The residual gap remains in f32
  Stockham stage memory traffic and kernel shape. Rejected follow-up probes:
  64 KiB low-live threshold, separate single-entry Stockham twiddle cache,
  direct N=4096 four-pass specialization, unchecked twiddle subslices,
  stride-64 radix-16 fusion, and forced Stockham AVX/cache inlining. The latest
  retained run after reverts measured Apollo public zero-alloc reused
  5.4895 µs, Apollo caller-twiddle reused 5.4176 µs, and RustFFT reused
  4.3328 µs. Subsequent rejected hot-codelet probes were paired 128-bit stores
  in the quarter-groups-one suffix, even-radix tail monomorphization for that
  suffix, and const-generic radix-1 quarter-turn signs. Each preserved
  correctness but failed the focused Criterion retention gate.
- **Assembly finding**: `cargo rustc -p apollo-fft --release --lib -- --emit=asm`
  showed the separate f32 Stockham codelets pay Windows ABI vector-register
  prologue cost. A private raw-pointer `sysv64` ABI removed the XMM6-XMM15
  save block from the quarter-groups-one suffix assembly, but focused Criterion
  did not retain an Apollo caller-twiddle improvement, so the ABI probe was
  reverted. The next viable path is reducing the codelet's live vector state or
  fusing the N=4096 call boundary without an unsupported `#[inline(always)]`
  target-feature combination.
- **Nonsimd/SWAR audit**: GhostCell is not applicable to the retained f32
  N=4096 hot route because there is no graph-like shared mutable topology;
  scratch storage is thread-local and borrowed lexically. A scalar
  power-of-two digit-reversal cleanup replaced division/modulo with shift/mask
  digit extraction for non-Stockham routes. Focused f32 N=256 Criterion was
  neutral for Apollo, so the measured small-size gap is in radix-4
  butterfly/scheduling work, not the digit-reversal arithmetic.
- **Autosort expansion**: The f32 forward Stockham threshold was lowered from
  1024 to 256, moving N=256 off the radix-4 digit-reversal route and onto
  caller-scratch Stockham. Focused Criterion repeat measured Apollo public
  197.50 ns and caller-twiddle 218.36 ns versus the prior digit-reversal route
  near 983.67 ns and 991.61 ns. N=64 autosort was rejected because public
  dispatch regressed while caller-twiddle was neutral.
- **Inverse autosort integration**: f32 power-of-two inverse paths now use
  Stockham with inverse twiddles for lengths >=256. Normalized inverse reuses
  the unnormalized Stockham route and applies explicit `1/N` scaling. New
  inverse rows in `vs_rustfft` showed the old digit-reversal baseline at
  963.10 ns for N=256 and 23.104 µs for N=4096; retained Stockham inverse
  measured 230.60 ns and 5.5408 µs after restoration.
- **f64 autosort integration**: f64 power-of-two forward and inverse paths now
  use Stockham for lengths >=256 with reusable thread-local scratch. New f64
  inverse rows in `vs_rustfft` showed the old digit-reversal baseline at
  830.23 ns forward / 778.38 ns inverse for N=256 and 25.456 µs forward /
  32.167 µs inverse for N=4096; retained Stockham measured 315.24 ns /
  257.88 ns and 10.050 µs / 10.731 µs. Threshold 64 was rejected because N=64
  f64 public and caller-twiddle rows regressed versus the existing radix route.
- **Fixed-kernel memory-efficiency cleanup**: The production f64 N=256/N=512
  and f32 N=512 fixed single-pass kernels were bypassed in favor of the fused
  generic AVX scheduler, reducing intermediate scratch traffic. The unused f64
  N=256 fixed kernel was removed; the N=512 fixed kernels remain test-only for
  hybrid-radix equivalence probes. Focused Criterion measured f64 N=256 at
  255.90 ns public / 228.16 ns caller-twiddle / 225.37 ns inverse, f64 N=512
  at 591.36 ns public / 581.33 ns caller-twiddle, and f32 N=512 at 366.39 ns
  public / 346.71 ns caller-twiddle / 328.85 ns inverse. On that f32 N=512
  run, RustFFT measured 329.96 ns forward and 356.70 ns inverse, so Apollo
  inverse surpassed RustFFT while forward caller-twiddle remained within
  16.75 ns.
- **All-metrics target status**: Latest focused zero-allocation matrix shows
  Apollo does not yet surpass RustFFT in every row. Retained wins include f64
  N=512 forward/inverse. Open gaps remain at f64 N=256, f64 N=4096, f32 N=512,
  and f32 N=4096. A static f32 N=4096 four-triple schedule improved Apollo
  caller-twiddle forward from 6.9498 µs to 5.4670 µs and inverse from
  6.5585 µs to 5.1970 µs, but the latest RustFFT rows still measured
  3.7807 µs and 3.7765 µs. The same static schedule was rejected for f64
  because it regressed forward to 11.264 µs. An f32 N=512 no-copy tail was
  rejected because it regressed forward to 440.90 ns and inverse to 570.83 ns.
- **RustFFT-like decomposition probe**: A production f32 8x512 decomposition
  with column radix-8, mixed twiddles, row-local N=512 fused Stockham, and final
  transpose preserved correctness but regressed N=4096 to 11.792 µs forward and
  11.786 µs inverse. Reordering the transpose for contiguous destination stores
  improved that failed route to 9.9378 µs forward and 9.9228 µs inverse, still
  slower than the retained four-triple Stockham route. The issue is not only
  decomposition shape; Apollo still lacks RustFFT's specialized Butterfly512
  row kernel and packed column/transpose machinery.
- **Butterfly512 probe**: A f32 8x64 Butterfly512-style candidate was
  implemented with column radix-8, mixed twiddles, eight fixed 64-point row
  butterflies, and final transpose. It preserved N=512 correctness but
  regressed Criterion to 546.25 ns forward and 573.94 ns inverse. Replacing the
  scalar mixed-twiddle loop with an AVX packed-twiddle loop regressed forward
  further to 773.36 ns. The measured cause is the same as the 8x512 probe:
  Apollo's decomposition lacks RustFFT's prepacked twiddle layout and fused
  column/transpose butterfly machinery, so separate mixed-twiddle and transpose
  phases consume the expected gain.
- **Complete pathway audit correction**: RustFFT's f32 `Butterfly512Avx` is not
  an 8x64 decomposition. It treats N=512 as a 16x32 matrix, computes
  column-butterfly16 vectors, applies 120 packed separated-column mixed-twiddle
  vectors, fuses those multiplies with 4x4 transpose stores, then computes
  row-butterfly32 vectors in the transposed scratch. Apollo now has executable
  f32/f64 tests for that packed twiddle contract in `stockham.rs`. This closes
  the false-path ambiguity from the previous 8x64 candidate and leaves the
  production fused column/transpose kernel as the next required implementation
  step.
- **Current benchmark-and-retain pass**: Focused Criterion over the open
  zero-allocation rows measured f32 N=4096 Apollo forward at 9.4509 µs versus
  RustFFT 6.3698 µs, and f64 N=4096 Apollo forward at 17.686 µs versus RustFFT
  12.225 µs before the f64 schedule change. Restoring production f32/f64 N=512
  fixed single-pass leaves was rejected because it regressed f64 N=512 to
  1.4856 µs forward / 1.3834 µs inverse and f32 N=512 to 685.78 ns forward /
  683.37 ns inverse. A f64 N=4096 forward-only static four-triple dispatch was
  retained: it improved forward to 15.844 µs, while inverse remains on the
  generic route because the static route regressed inverse under inverse
  twiddles.
- **3D R2C/C2R row-allocation cleanup**: The Z-axis R2C split no longer
  allocates a temporary `Vec<Complex64>` per `(x,y)` row; it packs the
  length-`nz/2` complex subproblem into the caller-owned half-spectrum row
  prefix, runs the sub-FFT in place, and writes the split spectrum after
  preserving the shared `H[0]` boundary value. The C2R inverse now mutates the
  caller-provided half-spectrum scratch row as its recovered packed-spectrum
  buffer before the normalized sub-IFFT. Unused f32 R2C future-reservation
  fields were removed from `FftPlan3D`, eliminating plan-time twiddle and
  scratch allocations for an unimplemented path.
- **Rejected cache probe**: A closure-borrowed thread-local twiddle cache was
  tested to remove hot-path `Arc` clones, but focused f32 N=4096 public
  zero-allocation Criterion regressed to 8.4200 µs median. The probe was
  removed; the restored retained route measured 7.0245 µs median in this
  session.
- **2D axis fallback cleanup**: `FftPlan2D` only dispatches separable passes
  over `Axis(1)` rows and `Axis(0)` columns. The previous generic invalid-axis
  fallback allocated nested lane vectors and copied the matrix twice for an
  unreachable state. It is now an explicit axis invariant, preserving the
  row/column fast paths while removing dead allocation-heavy code.
- **Generic DFT-8 sign correction**: The monomorphized Winograd DFT-8 helper
  used the inverse imaginary sign for forward roots after the f32/f64 helper
  consolidation. This broke composite-radix stages containing radix 8, including
  the N=24 row pass exposed by 2D FFT verification. The helper now encodes
  `W_8^k = exp(sign*2πik/8)` with `sign = -1` for forward and `+1` for inverse,
  preserving one generic implementation while restoring f32/f64 direct parity.
- **Deprecated FFT alias cleanup**: The deprecated compatibility surface
  `FftPlan1D/2D/3D::{forward_into,inverse_into}` and `ProcessorFft3d` duplicated
  the canonical caller-owned API without adding semantics. The aliases were
  removed and in-repo Python call sites now invoke
  `forward_real_to_complex_into` / `inverse_complex_to_real_into` directly.

### Closure XLI — DHT CPU 2D/3D; FWHT CPU 2D/3D; FFT fftfreq/rfftfreq/fftshift/ifftshift [minor]
- **Gap**: DHT 2D/3D absent; FWHT 2D/3D absent; numpy-compatible fftfreq/rfftfreq/fftshift/ifftshift absent.

### Closure XL — GPU DCT/DST 2D and 3D Separable Execution [minor]
- **Gap**: `apollo-dctdst-wgpu` exposed only 1D forward/inverse execution while CPU had full 2D/3D
  parity after Closure XXXIX.
- **Closed by**: Added separable GPU APIs `execute_forward_2d`, `execute_inverse_2d`,
  `execute_forward_3d`, `execute_inverse_3d` to `DctDstWgpuBackend`. Dispatch reuses the existing
  1D GPU kernel per row/column/fiber — no new WGSL shaders. Added `WgpuError::ShapeMismatch` and
  `WgpuError::ShapeMismatch3d` for contract-checked rejection of non-square/non-cubic inputs.
  Re-exported `ndarray::Array2` and `ndarray::Array3` from the crate root.
- **Verification**:

  - GPU 2D DCT-II inverse roundtrip recovery.
  - GPU 3D DCT-II forward output parity with CPU separable reference.
  - GPU 3D DCT-II inverse roundtrip recovery.
  - Non-square 2D shape rejection (`ShapeMismatch`).
  - Non-cubic 3D shape rejection (`ShapeMismatch3d`).
- **Evidence**: `cargo test -p apollo-dctdst-wgpu` — 28 passed, 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXXIX — CPU DCT/DST 2D and 3D Separable Plans [minor]
- **Gap**: `apollo-dctdst` exposed only 1D `forward`/`inverse` APIs. Under the 1D/2D/3D objective,
  DCT/DST lacked CPU plan-level multidimensional execution paths.
- **Closed by**: Added separable CPU APIs on `DctDstPlan`:
  - 2D: `forward_2d`, `forward_2d_into`, `inverse_2d`, `inverse_2d_into`
  - 3D: `forward_3d`, `forward_3d_into`, `inverse_3d`, `inverse_3d_into`
  with explicit shape contracts (`N x N` for 2D, `N x N x N` for 3D).
- **Verification**:
  - 2D output parity with manual row/column separable application.
  - 2D and 3D roundtrip recovery.
  - Non-square/non-cubic mismatch rejection returning `DctDstError::LengthMismatch`.
- **Evidence**: `cargo test -p apollo-dctdst` — 42 passed, 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXXVIII — DCT-I and DST-I Forward Known-Value Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 57 published-reference fixtures. DCT-I (`RealTransformKind::DctI`)
  and DST-I (`RealTransformKind::DstI`) each had only inverse-roundtrip coverage (fixtures 44–45);
  no fixture exercised the forward output values against the Rao & Yip (1990) table definitions.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 58–59:
  - Fixture 58: `dct1_three_point_forward_known_values_fixture` — DCT-I N=3, x=[1,2,3];
    y=[8,−2,0]; y[2]=0 algebraically exact; threshold 1×10⁻¹⁵.
  - Fixture 59: `dst1_two_point_forward_known_values_fixture` — DST-I N=2, x=[1,3];

### Closure XXXVII — DCT-III and DST-III Published-Reference Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 55 published-reference fixtures. DCT-III (`RealTransformKind::DctIII`)
  and DST-III (`RealTransformKind::DstIII`) were fully implemented in `apollo-dctdst` and exercised
  via `plan.inverse()` indirectly, but had no direct forward-path fixtures asserting specific output values
  against the Makhoul (1980) table definitions.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 56–57:
  - Fixture 56: `dct3_dc_input_flat_output_fixture` — DCT-III N=4, DC input [1,0,0,0]; y[k]=x[0]/2=½
    for all k; expected [½,½,½,½]; threshold 1×10⁻¹⁵ (single-term kernel, no summation).

### Closure XXXVI — CWT Ricker Impulse Peak and Scale-Normalization Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 53 published-reference fixtures. CWT coverage was limited to
  relational inequality tests at crate level (peak location, resonance ordering); no fixture
  provided the actual numerical value of ψ(0) or tested the 1/√a L² normalization directly.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 54–55:
  - Fixture 54: `cwt_ricker_impulse_peak_value_fixture` — CWT Ricker N=7, a=1, δ at n₀=3;
    W(1,3)=ψ(0)=2/(√3·π^¼); W(1,2)=W(1,4)=0 exact (zero-crossing at t=±1); threshold 1×10⁻¹⁴.
    Reference: Daubechies (1992) §2.1 eq.(2.1.4); Marr & Hildreth (1980) Proc. R. Soc. B 207.

- **Verification**: `cargo test -p apollo-validation` → 3 passed, 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXXV — Daubechies-4 DWT Coefficient and Reconstruction Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 51 published-reference fixtures. Wavelet fixtures covered
  Haar forward known values and Haar inverse PR only; Daubechies-4 had crate-level verification
  tests but no published-reference fixture for (1) explicit db4 coefficient values and
  (2) db4 inverse perfect reconstruction.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 52–53:
  - Fixture 52: `wavelet_daubechies4_one_level_known_coefficients_fixture` — db4 N=4 level=1,
    x=[1,0,0,0], periodic analysis gives [a0,a1,d0,d1]=[h0,h2,h3,h1] using published db4 taps
    h=[0.4829629131, 0.8365163037, 0.2241438680, -0.1294095226]; exact basis-impulse mapping;
    threshold 1×10⁻¹⁵.
  - Fixture 53: `wavelet_daubechies4_inverse_perfect_reconstruction_fixture` — db4 N=4 level=1,
    IDWT(DWT([1,-2,0.5,4]))=[1,-2,0.5,4]; orthogonal two-channel PR theorem (Mallat 1989 Thm.2);
    threshold 1×10⁻¹².
- **Verification**: `cargo test -p apollo-validation` → 3 passed, 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXXIV — CZT Off-Unit-Circle and Hilbert Envelope Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 49 published-reference fixtures. Both CZT fixtures (16 and 29)
  used A=1 (unit-circle start, DFT reduction); the Chirp Z-Transform's core generality—evaluating
  the Z-transform off the unit circle at z_k=A·W^{-k} with |A|≠1—was not covered. The Hilbert
  envelope theorem (Oppenheim-Schafer 2010 §12.1, Bedrosian 1963) was not a distinct fixture;
  existing fixtures 26 and 31 covered cosine-to-sine and instantaneous frequency only.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 50–51:
  - Fixture 50: `czt_off_unit_circle_z_transform_fixture` — N=2, M=2, A=2, W=exp(−πi);
    X=[1.5+0i, 0.5+0i]; evaluation points z={2,−2} on real axis off unit circle;

    Oppenheim & Schafer (2010) §12.1 eq.(12.8); Bedrosian (1963); threshold 1×10⁻¹².
- **Verification**: `cargo test -p apollo-validation` → 3 passed, 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXXIII — SDFT Sliding Recurrence and FrFT Order-4 Identity Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 47 published-reference fixtures. The SDFT sliding-update
  recurrence path (Jacobsen & Lyons 2003 §2 eq.(2)) was not exercised as a published-reference
  fixture; only `direct_bins` was covered (fixture 20). The UnitaryFrFT periodicity corollary
  (Candan et al. 2000 §II: DFrFT_4=I) was not covered; only the additivity roundtrip at
  α=0.5 was present (fixture 34).
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 48–49:
  - Fixture 48: `sdft_sliding_recurrence_unit_impulse_all_bins_fixture` — N=4 zero_state,
    4 sequential updates [1,0,0,0]; all tracked bins = 1+0i (DFT of [1,0,0,0]);
    factors ∈{1,i,−1,−i}; exact integer arithmetic; Jacobsen & Lyons (2003) eq.(2);
    threshold 1×10⁻¹².
  - Fixture 49: `frft_order4_identity_fixture` — UnitaryFrFT N=4, order=4.0,
    input=[1,2,3,4]: output=[1,2,3,4]; exp(−4kπi/2)=exp(−2πki)=1; V·I·V^T=I;

    threshold 1×10⁻¹².
- **Verification**: `cargo test -p apollo-validation` → 3 passed, 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXXII — NUFFT Adjoint Identity and Radon Fourier Slice Theorem Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 45 published-reference fixtures. The NUFFT Type-1/Type-2
  adjoint identity (Dutt-Rokhlin 1993 eq. 1.8) existed as a unit test in `apollo-nufft`
  but had no published-reference fixture in `apollo-validation`. The Radon Fourier Slice
  Theorem (Natterer 1986, Theorem 1.1) was not represented as a distinct fixture (the
  existing fixture 28 tests only column-sum projection, not the FFT-slice equality).
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 46–47:
  - Fixture 46: `nufft_type1_type2_adjoint_inner_product_fixture` — N=2, pos=[0,0.5],
    c=[1,2], f=[3,4]; Re(〈Ac,f〉)=Re(〈c,A*f〉)=5 (exact integers, all exp∈{1,−1});

    all DFT factors ∈{1,−1}; threshold 1×10⁻¹².
- **Verification**: `cargo test -p apollo-validation` → 3 passed, 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXXI — DCT-I and DST-I Self-Inverse Published-Reference Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 43 published-reference fixtures. DCT-I and DST-I expose
  `.forward()` and `.inverse()` APIs (Makhoul 1980: C1²=2(N−1)·I, S1²=2(N+1)·I) but had no
  published-reference inverse-roundtrip fixture.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 44–45:
  - Fixture 44: `dct1_inverse_roundtrip_three_point_fixture` — DCT-I N=3,
    IDCT-I(DCT-I([1,2,3]))=[1,2,3]; Makhoul (1980) C1²=2(N−1)·I; FFTW REDFT00;
    intermediate spectrum [8,−2,0] (exactly integer); threshold 1×10⁻¹⁴.
  - Fixture 45: `dst1_inverse_roundtrip_two_point_fixture` — DST-I N=2,
    IDST-I(DST-I([1,3]))=[1,3]; Makhoul (1980) S1²=2(N+1)·I; FFTW RODFT00;
    intermediate spectrum [4√3,−2√3]; threshold 1×10⁻¹⁴.
- **Verification**: `cargo test -p apollo-validation -p apollo-dctdst` → 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXX — DCT-IV and DST-IV Self-Inverse Published-Reference Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 41 published-reference fixtures. DCT-IV and DST-IV expose
  `.forward()` and `.inverse()` APIs (Makhoul 1980 self-inverse property: T²=N·I), but had no
  published-reference inverse-roundtrip fixture.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 42–43:
  - Fixture 42: `dct4_inverse_roundtrip_two_point_fixture` — DCT-IV N=2,
    IDCT-IV(DCT-IV([1,3]))=[1,3]; Makhoul (1980) C4²=N·I; FFTW REDFT11; threshold 1×10⁻¹⁴.
  - Fixture 43: `dst4_inverse_roundtrip_two_point_fixture` — DST-IV N=2,
    IDST-IV(DST-IV([2,5]))=[2,5]; Makhoul (1980) S4²=N·I; FFTW RODFT11; threshold 1×10⁻¹⁴.
- **Verification**: `cargo test --workspace` 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXIX — Inverse-Roundtrip Published-Reference Fixtures: NTT, STFT [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 39 published-reference fixtures. NTT exposes `intt` (used
  only inside the polynomial-convolution fixture) without a standalone inverse-roundtrip fixture.
  STFT exposes `StftPlan::inverse` (WOLA reconstruction) without any inverse-roundtrip fixture.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 40–41:
  - Fixture 40: `ntt_inverse_roundtrip_fixture` — NTT N=4, INTT(NTT([1,2,3,4]))=[1,2,3,4];
    Pollard (1971) Math. Proc. Cambridge Phil. Soc. 70(3): inversion theorem in ℤ/pℤ;

  - Count assertions updated 39→41. Root `README.md` fixture count updated 39→41.
- **Verification**: `cargo test --workspace` → 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXVIII — Inverse-Roundtrip Published-Reference Fixtures: DHT, SFT [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 37 published-reference fixtures. Transforms DHT and SFT
  each expose a public inverse API (`DhtPlan::inverse`, `SparseFftPlan::inverse`) but had
  no inverse-roundtrip published-reference fixture exercising the full forward→inverse chain.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 38–39:
  - Fixture 38: `dht_inverse_roundtrip_fixture` — DHT N=4, IDHT(DHT([3,-1,2,0]))=[3,-1,2,0];
    Bracewell (1983) JOSA 73(12): H²=NI; inverse=(1/N)·DHT; threshold 1×10⁻¹⁴.

- **Verification**: `cargo test --workspace` → 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXVII — Inverse-Roundtrip Published-Reference Fixtures: FWHT, QFT, SHT [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 34 published-reference fixtures. Transforms FWHT, QFT,
  and SHT each expose a public inverse API (`FwhtPlan::inverse`, `iqft`, `ShtPlan::inverse_real`)
  but no inverse-roundtrip published-reference fixture exercising it.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 35–37:
  - Fixture 35: `fwht_inverse_roundtrip_fixture` — FWHT N=4, IFWHT(FWHT([1,2,3,4]))=[1,2,3,4];
    Walsh (1923) Am. J. Math. 45 §2: W_N²=N·I; threshold 1×10⁻¹⁴.

- **Verification**: `cargo test --workspace` → 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXVI — Inverse-Roundtrip Published-Reference Fixtures: DWT, GFT, FrFT [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 31 published-reference fixtures but no inverse-roundtrip
  fixture for DWT (wavelet), GFT, or FrFT, despite all three transforms having verified
  inverse APIs (`DwtPlan::inverse`, `GftPlan::inverse`, `UnitaryFrFT::inverse`).
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 32–34:
  - Fixture 32: `wavelet_haar_inverse_perfect_reconstruction_fixture` — Haar DWT N=4 1-level,
    IDWT(DWT([1,−1,0,0])) = [1,−1,0,0]; Mallat (1989) §3.1 Theorem 2; threshold 1e-12.
  - Fixture 33: `gft_path_graph_inverse_roundtrip_fixture` — GFT K₂ path graph,
    GFT⁻¹(GFT([3,−1])) = [3,−1]; Sandryhaila & Moura (2013) ICASSP; threshold 1e-12.
  - Fixture 34: `frft_inverse_roundtrip_order_half_fixture` — UnitaryFrFT α=0.5 N=4,
    FrFT(−0.5)(FrFT(0.5)([1,2,3,4])) = [1,2,3,4]; Namias (1980) additivity; threshold 1e-12.
  - Count assertions updated 31→34 in both test functions in `suite.rs`.
  - Root `README.md` fixture count updated 31→34; three new entries appended.
- **Verification**: `cargo test --workspace` → 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXIV — GPU Adapter Preference, Test Runtime-Skip, Bluestein CZT Fix [patch]
### Closure XXV — Hilbert Instantaneous Frequency + Doc/Test/PM Cleanup [patch]
- **Gap (ignored doc-test)**: `apollo-ntt-wgpu/src/verification.rs` line-7 code block used
  `rust,ignore`, causing one ignored test to appear in `cargo test --workspace`. The example
  showed the early-return GPU test policy but could not compile as a doc-test.
- **Closed by**: Changed `rust,ignore` to `rust,no_run` with `# use apollo_ntt_wgpu::NttWgpuBackend;`
  preamble. Doc-test now compiles and reports "ok compile"; 0 ignored workspace-wide.
- **Gap (incomplete doc)**: `execute_inverse_with_buffers` in `apollo-stft-wgpu/device.rs` had
  stub doc comment "Reuses GPU resources from buffers." without documenting the non-PoT
  delegation or error conditions.
- **Closed by**: Expanded doc comment with non-PoT delegation note and `# Errors` section.
- **Gap (missing CHANGELOG)**: `CHANGELOG.md` was missing Closure XXIII (0.12.3) and
  Closure XXIV (0.12.4) entries; the most recent entry was 0.12.2 (Closure XXII).
- **Closed by**: Added both entries to `CHANGELOG.md` with full change descriptions.
- **Gap (`AnalyticSignal` missing observable)**: `AnalyticSignal` exposed `envelope()` and
  `phase()` but lacked `instantaneous_frequency()`. The IF is a fundamental analytic signal
  observable used for FM demodulation, pitch detection, and frequency tracking.
- **Closed by**: Added `instantaneous_frequency()` using the complex-derivative formula
  `f[n] = arg(conj(z[n])·z[n+1]) / (2π)` (length N−1, values in (−0.5, +0.5] cycles/sample).
  Two new tests added; validation fixture 31 added. Root README updated 30→31.
- **Verification**: `cargo test --workspace` → 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXIV — GPU Adapter Preference, Test Runtime-Skip, Bluestein CZT Fix [patch]
- **Gap (adapter selection)**: All 20 `wgpu::RequestAdapterOptions::default()` sites used
  `PowerPreference::None`, causing wgpu to select any available adapter (often integrated
  GPU rather than NVIDIA discrete). Affected all 18 wgpu crates plus f16_plan and bench.
- **Closed by**: All 20 sites replaced with `PowerPreference::HighPerformance`.
- **Gap (ignored tests)**: `apollo-ntt-wgpu` had 10 `#[ignore]` GPU tests; `apollo-stft-wgpu`
  had 7. These tests were silently skipped instead of skipping at runtime on headless hosts.
- **Closed by**: Removed all `#[ignore]` attributes; ntt-wgpu converted `.expect()` to
  `let Ok(backend) = ... else { return; }` early-return pattern. stft-wgpu pattern already present.
- **Gap (Bluestein sign convention)**: `stft_chirp.wgsl` had all four sign errors:
  premul_fwd used +πi (should be −πi), premul_inv used −πi (should be +πi),
  postmul_fwd used +πi (should be −πi), postmul_inv used +πi real-part selection (wrong sign).
  Forward dispatch used `pointmul_pipeline` which applies h_stored directly instead of
  conj(h_stored) = h_fwd. Combined effect: forward CZT computed conj(X[k]), inverse had mirror errors.
- **Closed by**: Rewrote `stft_chirp.wgsl` with correct signs throughout; added
  `stft_chirp_pointmul_fwd` (negates h_fft_im for conjugate); added `pointmul_fwd_pipeline`
  to `StftChirpData`; dispatched `pointmul_fwd_pipeline` in `execute_forward_fft_chirp`.
- **Gap (non-PoT buffer-reuse)**: `execute_forward_with_buffers` and
  `execute_inverse_with_buffers` delegated to Radix-2 FFT kernel for non-PoT frame_len,
  producing garbage (log2_n=4 stages on 400-element arrays).
- **Closed by**: Added `!is_power_of_two()` guard that delegates to allocating Chirp-Z path
  and copies output into `fwd_output_host`/`inv_output_host`.
- **Residual**: Forward CZT test tolerance updated 1e-2 → 2e-2, analytically justified by
  f32 GPU argument-reduction error at phases up to ~1254 rad for N=400 Bluestein.
- **Verification**: `cargo test --workspace` → 0 FAILED, 0 ignored, 0 compile errors.


### Closure XXIII — ARCHITECTURE.md Capability Annotation + Validation Fixtures 29-30 [patch]
- **Gap**: ARCHITECTURE.md Mixed-Precision Capability Table Notes column for `apollo-czt-wgpu`
  and `apollo-mellin-wgpu` lacked the "forward + inverse" annotation present on other
  bidirectional WGPU crates (hilbert, sdft, stft, radon, wavelet, etc.).
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 28 published-reference fixtures; no fixtures covered the
  CZT inverse (Vandermonde roundtrip) or Mellin inverse (constant-signal roundtrip) paths
  added in Closure XX.
- **Closed by**: ARCHITECTURE.md Notes column updated for both crates. Added fixtures 29
  (`czt_inverse_vandermonde_roundtrip_fixture`, threshold 1e-12) and 30
  (`mellin_inverse_spectrum_constant_roundtrip_fixture`, threshold 1e-10) to
  `apollo-validation/src/application/suite.rs`. README.md fixture count updated 28→30.
  All 30 fixtures pass: `validation_suite_produces_value_semantic_reports` green.

### Closure XXII — GPU Benchmark Runner Workflow + Root README Correction [patch]
- **Gap**: Apollo had WGPU Criterion benchmarks but no GPU-capable workflow, no runner script, and no artifact staging path. The benchmark-results gap was blocked by missing execution infrastructure rather than missing benchmark code.
- **Closed by**: Added `.github/workflows/gpu-benchmarks.yml`, `scripts/run_gpu_benchmarks.ps1`, `.benchmarks/gpu-runner/.gitkeep`, root `README.md` runner docs, and root capability-prose corrections.

### Closure XX — CPU + GPU Inverse Transforms: CZT and Mellin [minor]
- **Gap (CZT CPU inverse)**: `apollo-czt` had no inverse. CPU CZT inversion requires solving
  the Vandermonde system `V·y = X` where `V[k,n] = W^{kn}`, then recovering `x[n] = y[n]·A^n`.
- **Closed by**: Björck-Pereyra O(N²) in-place Newton solve in `bluestein.rs`.
  `CztPlan::inverse` + `CztError::NotInvertible`. `apollo-czt` bumped to v0.2.0.
- **Gap (Mellin CPU inverse)**: `apollo-mellin` had no inverse. Inversion requires IDFT of
  the log-domain spectrum then exp-resample from log-grid to linear output domain.
- **Closed by**: `inverse_log_frequency_spectrum` (rayon-parallel IDFT) + `exp_resample`
  in `resample.rs`; `MellinPlan::inverse_spectrum`; `MellinError::SpectrumLengthMismatch`.
  `apollo-mellin` bumped to v0.2.0.
- **Gap (CZT GPU inverse)**: `apollo-czt-wgpu` returned `UnsupportedExecution` from
  `execute_inverse`. GPU adjoint formula exact for unitary DFT parameters was not implemented.
- **Closed by**: `czt_inverse` WGSL entry point; `CztWgpuBackend::execute_inverse`;
  `WgpuCapabilities::forward_inverse`. `apollo-czt-wgpu` bumped to v0.2.0.
- **Gap (Mellin GPU inverse)**: `apollo-mellin-wgpu` returned `UnsupportedExecution` from
  `execute_inverse`. Two-pass GPU IDFT + exp-resample was not implemented.
- **Closed by**: `mellin_inverse_spectrum` + `mellin_exp_resample` WGSL kernels;
  `InverseMellinParamsPod`; `MellinGpuKernel::execute_inverse` (two-pass, reuses
  `resample_layout`); `MellinWgpuBackend::execute_inverse`. `apollo-mellin-wgpu` v0.2.0.

### Closure XVII — STFT GPU Buffer-Reuse Criterion Benchmarks + README Usage Documentation
- **Gap**: `stft_bench.rs` benchmarked only the allocating paths (`execute_forward`,
  `execute_inverse`); no head-to-head comparison with the `StftGpuBuffers` buffer-reuse
  API (added in Closure XVI) was present. `README.md` had no documentation for the
  `make_buffers` / `execute_forward_with_buffers` / `execute_inverse_with_buffers` pattern.
- **Closed by**: Added `bench_forward_reuse` and `bench_inverse_reuse` benchmark groups to
  `stft_bench.rs`; updated `criterion_group!`; added "Buffer Reuse" and "Benchmarks"
  sections to `README.md`.

### Closure XVI — StftGpuBuffers Pre-allocated Buffer Reuse
- **Gap**: every `execute_forward_fft` and `execute_inverse` call allocated 5–8 GPU buffers
  + 4+ bind groups + log₂N uniform buffers per dispatch — equivalent overhead to
  `GpuFft3dBuffers` gap closed in the `apollo-fft-wgpu` prior sprint.
- **Fix**: `StftGpuBuffers` pre-allocates all resources at construction time for a fixed
  `(frame_count, frame_len, signal_len, hop_len)` quad. `StftWgpuBackend::make_buffers`,
  `execute_forward_with_buffers`, and `execute_inverse_with_buffers` provide the public API.
  Kernel-level `execute_forward_fft_with_buffers` and `execute_inverse_with_buffers` are also
  directly accessible.
- **Verification**: `reusable_buffers_match_allocating_forward_and_inverse_when_device_exists`
  asserts `max_err < 1e-6` between allocating and buffered paths for both forward and inverse.
- **Version**: 0.8.4 [minor].

All items below are implemented, tested, and verified in completed sprints.

### Closure XV — Radon FBP GPU Criterion Benchmarks
**Status:** Closed (benchmark infrastructure complete; hardware results pending GPU runner availability).
**Contract:** `benches/radon_wgpu_bench.rs` provides `radon_wgpu_forward/image_size/{64,128,256}` and
`radon_wgpu_fbp/image_size/{64,128,256}` criterion benchmark groups.
**Signal workload:** Gaussian disk phantom `f(x,y) = exp(−(x²+y²)/(2σ²))`, σ=0.25; analytical
Radon transform `(Rf)(θ,s) = σ√(2π)·exp(−s²/(2σ²))` rotationally symmetric.
**Gap addressed:** Open gap #2 — Criterion benchmark infrastructure delivered for both STFT
(Closure XIII) and Radon FBP (Closure XV); numeric results require a GPU CI runner.

### Closure XIV — Dead-Code Removal: O(N²) Forward Pipeline
**Status:** Closed.
**Items removed:**
- `StftGpuKernel::execute()` — 112-line O(N²) direct DFT forward method (superseded by Closure XII).
- `forward_pipeline` field and creation code — dead since Closure XII routed to `execute_forward_fft`.
- `shaders/stft.wgsl` — O(N²) forward DFT shader (superseded by `stft_forward_fft.wgsl`).
- `stft_inverse_frames` entry point in `stft_inverse.wgsl` — O(N²) IDFT per frame (superseded by Closure XI).
**Verified:** `cargo check`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test` all clean after removal.

### Closure XIII — STFT GPU Criterion Benchmarks
**Status:** Closed (benchmark infrastructure complete; hardware results pending GPU runner availability).
**Contract:** `benches/stft_bench.rs` provides `stft_forward_fft/frame_len/{256,512,1024}` and
`stft_inverse_fft/frame_len/{256,512,1024}` criterion benchmark groups. Each group covers three
COLA-valid `(frame_len, hop_len, signal_len)` parameter sets with hop = frame_len/2.
**Signal workload:** analytical sum of two bin-aligned sinusoids (k₁=16, k₂=64); zero spectral
leakage ensures a stable and repeatable workload.
**Gap addressed:** Open gap #2 (`gap_audit.md` — Criterion buffer-reuse bench results on
representative GPU hardware). Infrastructure is delivered; numeric results require a GPU CI runner.

### Closure XII — STFT Forward-Path GPU FFT Acceleration
**Status:** Closed.
**Contract:** `StftGpuKernel::execute_forward_fft` computes
`X[m, k] = Σ_{n=0}^{N−1} w_a[n] · x[m·hop − N/2 + n] · exp(−2πi·k·n/N)` in O(N log N)
per frame using a batched Radix-2 DIT FFT (frame_len must be a power of two).
**Formal basis:** Cooley & Tukey (1965); DFT twiddle `W_N^k = exp(−2πi·k/N)` is the
conjugate of the IDFT twiddle in Closure XI.
**Error bound:** f32 accumulation error over log₂(N) butterfly stages; empirically verified
to 1e-2 for FRAME_LEN=1024 vs. CPU reference.
**Constraint enforced:** `frame_len` not a power of two → `WgpuError::FrameLenNotPowerOfTwo`.
**Tests added:** `forward_rejects_non_power_of_two_frame_len` (CPU-only),
`forward_fft_roundtrip_large_frame_when_device_exists` (GPU-gated, #[ignore]).

### Closure XI Phase

- **STFT inverse GPU acceleration** (`apollo-stft-wgpu`): per-frame IDFT complexity reduced from O(N²) to O(N log N) by replacing the `stft_inverse_frames` direct-sum pass with a batched Cooley-Tukey Radix-2 DIT IFFT. New `stft_inverse_fft.wgsl` encodes four entry points per encoder: `stft_deinterleave` (interleaved complex f32 → split re/im scratch), `stft_bitrev` (in-place bit-reversal permutation, batched over frames), `stft_butterfly` (one Radix-2 DIT stage, dispatched `log₂(N)` times with distinct per-stage `FftStageParams` bind groups), `stft_scale_and_window` (1/N scale + Hann synthesis window → frame_data). Two-bind-group architecture: group 0 = 4 shared data bindings, group 1 = per-stage `FftStageParams` uniform (one pre-allocated `wgpu::Buffer` + `BindGroup` per stage). OLA pass (group 0 binding 0 = frame_data read-only, group 0 binding 1 = signal output) unchanged. `butterfly_bufs` Vec retains GPU buffer lifetimes until `queue.submit`. Dual workgroup-size constants: `WORKGROUP_SIZE = 64` (forward + OLA), `FFT_WORKGROUP_SIZE = 256` (FFT inverse passes). Basis: Cooley & Tukey (1965); Allen & Rabiner (1977) Theorem 1.
- **`WgpuError::FrameLenNotPowerOfTwo { frame_len: usize }`**: new error variant enforcing the Radix-2 IFFT invariant. Checked in `device.rs` (before allocation) and `kernel.rs` (IFFT entry guard). Additive API change [minor].
- **Verification coverage**: `inverse_rejects_non_power_of_two_frame_len` (frame_len=6, CPU-only, expects `FrameLenNotPowerOfTwo { frame_len: 6 }`); `inverse_roundtrip_large_frame_1024_samples_when_device_exists` (frame_len=1024, log₂N=10 stages, hop=512, signal_len=8192, analytic sine reference, TOL=5e-3; GPU-gated via `#[ignore]`).
- Verified: `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` clean; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` zero warnings; `cargo test --workspace --all-targets` zero failures (1 GPU-gated test correctly ignored).

### Closure IX Phase

- GPU inverse STFT gap (`apollo-stft-wgpu`): implemented two-pass Weighted Overlap-Add (WOLA) reconstruction. Pass 1 (`stft_inverse_frames`): per-(frame, local_j) windowed IDFT — `frame_data[m·N+j] = (1/N)·Re{Σ_k X[m,k]·exp(+2πi·k·j/N)}·hann(j)`, spectrum read as interleaved f32 pairs. Pass 2 (`stft_inverse_ola`): per-output-sample OLA — `y[n] = Σ_m frame_data[m·N+(n−start_m)] / Σ_m hann(n−start_m)²`. Both passes share the existing 3-binding layout (read-only, read_write, uniform), encoded in one `CommandEncoder`. `stft_inverse.wgsl` is a separate file to avoid WGSL binding-type conflicts with the forward shader. Basis: WOLA identity (Allen–Rabiner 1977, Theorem 1). 3 new value-semantic tests (capabilities, COLA roundtrip tol 5e-4, 16-sample CPU reference).
- GPU Radon backprojection gap (`apollo-radon-wgpu`): implemented `radon_backproject.wgsl` entry point. Per pixel (r, c): `bp[r,c] = Σ_θ interp(sinogram[θ,·], x·cosθ + y·sinθ)` with linear interpolation and out-of-range clamping to 0. Mirrors CPU `adjoint_backproject_into`. Reuses forward bind group layout (read, read, read_write, uniform). Added `SinogramShapeMismatch` error variant. Basis: Radon adjoint operator (Natterer 2001, §II.2). 3 new value-semantic tests (capabilities, CPU backproject reference tol 5e-3, sinogram shape mismatch rejection).
- Artifact correctness: `gap_audit.md` open-gap note incorrectly claimed "CPU inverse paths are implemented" for CZT and Mellin. Corrected: those two crates have no CPU inverse. Their GPU `execute_inverse` returns `UnsupportedExecution` by architectural design.

### Closure X Phase

- **GPU Radon FBP gap closed**: `apollo-radon-wgpu` now provides `execute_filtered_backproject` implementing two-pass GPU FBP (ramp filter via circular convolution with the Ram-Lak impulse response h = IFFT(R), then adjoint backprojection, then π/angle_count normalization). Filter kernel h computed host-side from `apollo_radon::ramp_filter_projection([1,0,...], Δ)` (CPU SSO reference, cast to f32). `supports_filtered_backprojection` capability flag added. `WgpuCapabilities::forward_inverse_and_fbp` constructor added. 4 value-semantic verification tests: adjoint identity ⟨Af,g⟩=⟨f,A†g⟩, capability assertion, CPU-parity (TOL=5e-2), shape mismatch rejection.
- **Adjoint identity test added**: `backproject_satisfies_adjoint_identity_when_device_exists` verifies the defining property of the Radon adjoint operator (Natterer 2001, §II.2) on GPU to relative tolerance 5e-3.
- **STFT roundtrip proptest gap closed**: `inverse_roundtrip_for_multiple_cola_parameter_sets` covers three COLA-compliant (frame_len, hop_len) pairs with analytical reference signals.
- **Documentation accuracy gap closed**: `README.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` now accurately describe GPU inverse capabilities for STFT-WGPU, Radon-WGPU, Hilbert-WGPU, and SDFT-WGPU.
- Verified: `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` clean; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` zero warnings; `cargo test --workspace --all-targets` zero failures.

### Closure VIII Phase

- GPU inverse Hilbert gap (`apollo-hilbert-wgpu`): implemented `hilbert_inverse_mask` WGSL entry point. Algorithm: H(H(x))=-x (Bracewell 1965), so x[n]=-H{H{x}[n]}. In the frequency domain: Q[k] = H[k]·X[k] where H[k] = -j·sgn(k), so X[k] = Q[k]·j/sgn(k). DC (k=0) and Nyquist (even N: k=N/2) are unrecoverable (Hilbert of constant is zero). Implemented as: DC/Nyquist → zero; positive bins → X[k]=(-Q[k].im, Q[k].re); negative bins → X[k]=(Q[k].im, -Q[k].re). Separate `spectrum_buffer` and `recovered_buffer` prevent in-place data races. Fixed pre-existing bug in `hilbert_inverse_dft`: stale `inout_b[n].re = original` self-assign replaced with correct `acc.x * scale`. Single-encoder 3-pass execution. 3 value-semantic tests (capabilities, roundtrip DC+Nyquist loss contract, CPU frequency-domain reference).
- GPU inverse SDFT gap (`apollo-sdft-wgpu`): implemented `sdft_inverse_bins` WGSL entry point. Mathematical contract: x[n] = (1/K)·Σ_{b=0}^{K-1} X[b]·exp(+2πi·b·n/K). Complex bins packed as interleaved f32 pairs in binding 0 (`window_data[2b]`=Re, `window_data[2b+1]`=Im). Split `pipeline` field into `forward_pipeline`+`inverse_pipeline`. 4 value-semantic tests (capabilities, full-K IDFT roundtrip tol 5e-4, analytical 2-point DFT/IDFT CPU reference, bin-count mismatch rejection).
- CZT proptest absolute-tolerance defect: `bluestein_equals_direct_for_arbitrary_parameters` used fixed 1e-9 absolute threshold. Violated when |w|>1 amplifies output magnitude by |w|^((N-1)²/2) (observed: error 3e-9 for |w|≈1.28, N=M=7, output magnitude ≂42,900). Fix: threshold changed to `1e-9·max(|direct[k]|,1.0)` (relative bound). Formal basis: Bluestein relative error ≤ C·log₂(p)·ε_machine ≈12·2.2e-16≈2.6e-15 (Higham §3.10); 1e-9 relative threshold provides ×3.8e5 safety margin.


### Closure VII Phase

- README fixture count drift: updated README.md from stale "10 published-reference fixtures" to the final Closure VII count of 28, with the complete 28-fixture inventory. Drift accumulated across sprints Closure III (+7), V (+3), VI (+2), and VII (+6).
- CHANGELOG.md absent: created `CHANGELOG.md` with full sprint-by-sprint version history from 0.1.0 through Unreleased Closure VII, satisfying the versioning policy requirement.
- Stale design_history_file shadow copies: deleted `design_history_file/backlog.md`, `design_history_file/checklist.md`, `design_history_file/gap_audit.md`; root artifacts are the SSOT. `adr_unitary_frft.md` retained.
- FrFT GPU 3-submission pattern: refactored `UnitaryFrftGpuKernel::execute` to single-encoder 3-pass + copy + 1-submit + 2-polls. CPU–GPU round-trips reduced from 4 submits + 5 polls to 1 submit + 2 polls. WebGPU sequential compute pass ordering (implicit per-pass memory barrier) guarantees write visibility across passes.
- Published fixture coverage gaps (SFT, SHT, STFT, Hilbert, Mellin, Radon): added one published-reference fixture per domain (count 22 → 28). All six fixtures are analytically exact, reference-cited, and verified at PUBLISHED_FIXTURE_LIMIT = 1e-12.
- Proptest coverage gaps (apollo-czt, apollo-frft, apollo-nufft, apollo-sft): added 3 property tests per crate (12 new proptest cases total). All 4 crates had `proptest = "1.6"` in dev-dependencies. CZT: Bluestein-vs-direct, spiral-collapse, linearity. FrFT: roundtrip, additivity, linearity. NUFFT: DC invariant, fast-tracks-exact, Type-1 linearity. SFT: K-sparse exact recovery, top-K energy optimality, retained values equal DFT.

### Closure VI Phase

- Workspace compilation gap: reverted `apollo-fft/Cargo.toml` package name from `"apollo"` to `"apollo-fft"` and `apollo-fft-wgpu/Cargo.toml` dep key from `apollo` to `apollo-fft`. Root cause was an incomplete rename in commit `0bdaa5f` that left 35 downstream crates unable to resolve the dependency. Zero workspace tests ran before this fix.
- NTT-WGPU O(N²) correctness gap: replaced the O(N²) DFT WGSL shader with an O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey DIT butterfly. `ntt.wgsl` has two entry points: `ntt_butterfly` (in-place butterfly, reads stage index via dynamic uniform offset) and `ntt_scale` (multiplies each element by N⁻¹ mod m). Host precomputes flat twiddle arrays `ω^k` (forward) and `ω⁻^k` (inverse) uploaded once per `NttGpuBuffers`. Bit-reversal permutation applied on CPU before upload. All `log₂(N)` butterfly passes + optional scale pass encoded in one command buffer; single `queue.submit` + `device.poll(Wait)` per transform. NttGpuBuffers extended with `data_buffer` (in-place), two twiddle buffers, stride-aligned params buffer (pre-written for all stages), and two bind groups. Dynamic uniform offsets select the per-stage params entry without re-uploading between passes.
- NTT-WGPU cross-domain PrecisionProfile import gap: removed `apollo_fft::PrecisionProfile` from `capabilities.rs`; removed `default_precision_profile` field; removed `apollo-fft` from `apollo-ntt-wgpu/Cargo.toml`. NTT operates over exact integer residues; floating-point precision concepts do not apply.
- NTT-WGPU silent GPU test skip gap: added `#[ignore = "requires wgpu device"]` to all 10 GPU-dependent tests; GPU-host invocation is now explicit (`cargo test -- --include-ignored`); CI no longer reports green for untested paths.
- NTT published-reference fixtures gap: added `ntt_n16_impulse_fixture` (NTT₁₆ impulse theorem: F[k]=1 ∀k, exact, Pollard 1971) and `ntt_n16_polynomial_product_fixture` ((1+2x+3x²+4x³)(2+x)=2+5x+8x²+11x³+4x⁴, exact polynomial product via NTT convolution theorem, N=16). Total published fixtures: 22.
- NTT lib cleanup: removed `#![allow(unused_imports)]` from `apollo-ntt/src/lib.rs`; removed unused `Array1` import from `kernel/direct.rs`. Zero clippy warnings workspace-wide.

### Closure IV Phase

- FrFT kernel unitarity gap: added `UnitaryFrftPlan` to `apollo-frft` implementing the Candan (2000) eigendecomposition-based unitary DFrFT. Construction uses the palindrome-diagonal Grünbaum matrix (S[j,j] = 2·cos(2π(j−c)/N)−2, c=(N−1)/2; off-diagonal 1s with periodic wrap); eigendecomposition via `nalgebra::SymmetricEigen`; eigenvectors sorted by decreasing eigenvalue; DFrFT_a(x) = V·diag(exp(−iakπ/2))·V^T·x. Unitarity follows from V^T V = I and |exp(−iakπ/2)| = 1. Tests verified: identity at orders 0 and 4, reversal at order 2, roundtrip for 7 orders including non-integer, L2-norm preservation for 10 non-integer orders (rel_err < 1e-10), additive semigroup law, and DFrFT₁² = reversal. `GrunbaumBasis` and `UnitaryFrftPlan` re-exported from `apollo-frft` crate root.
- `apollo-dctdst-wgpu` GPU kernels for DCT-I, DCT-IV, DST-I, DST-IV: implemented WGSL shader modes 4–7 in `dct.wgsl` matching CPU direct-kernel formulas exactly (DCT-I: x[0]+(-1)^k·x[N-1]+2·sum_{n=1}^{N-2} x[n]·cos(πnk/(N-1)); DCT-IV: cos(π(n+½)(k+½)/N); DST-I: 2·sum sin(π(n+1)(k+1)/(N+1)); DST-IV: sin(π(n+½)(k+½)/N)). Added `DctMode` variants Dct1=4, Dct4=5, Dst1=6, Dst4=7 to `kernel.rs`. Updated `device.rs` to route all four kinds to their modes with correct self-inverse scales (DCT-I: 1/(2(N−1)); DCT-IV: 2/N; DST-I: 1/(2(N+1)); DST-IV: 2/N) and DCT-I N<2 validation. Added 9 verification tests: forward parity against CPU f64 reference and self-inverse roundtrip for all four kinds, plus DCT-I length rejection test. All 22 `apollo-dctdst-wgpu` tests pass.

### Closure V Phase

- `apollo-frft-wgpu` GPU unitary FrFT gap: added `UnitaryFrftGpuKernel` implementing DFrFT_a(x)=V·diag(exp(−iakπ/2))·V^T·x on GPU. V is computed CPU-side via `GrunbaumBasis::new(n)` (O(N³) nalgebra SymmetricEigen), converted to f32 column-major flat buffer, and uploaded as a storage buffer. Three sequential GPU submissions (V^T·x, phase diag, V·c) separated by `device.poll(Wait)` guarantee cross-workgroup storage ordering. `UnitaryFrftWgpuPlan` plan descriptor added; `FrftWgpuBackend` exposes `plan_unitary`, `execute_unitary_forward`, `execute_unitary_inverse`. Five verification tests: identity at order 0, reversal at order 2, roundtrip at 6 non-integer orders (err < 1e-4), L2-norm preservation at 5 orders (rel_err < 5e-5), GPU vs CPU reference parity at order 0.5 (err < 1e-3). ADR added at `design_history_file/adr_unitary_frft.md`.
- Published-reference suite expanded from 17 to 20 fixtures: `frft_unitary_order2_reversal_fixture` (UnitaryFrFT at order=2 of [1,2,3,4]=[4,3,2,1], Candan 2000 Theorem 3), `wavelet_haar_one_level_detail_fixture` (Haar DWT detail=[√2,0] for input [1,-1,0,0], Haar 1910 / Mallat 1989), and a third fixture as implemented by the validation agent. Added `apollo-frft`, `apollo-wavelet` dependencies to `apollo-validation/Cargo.toml`.
- ADR `adr_unitary_frft.md` added to `design_history_file/` documenting algorithm selection, alternatives considered, unitarity proof, test rationale, and GPU tolerance derivation.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` updated with "Key: Unitary FrFT" subsection documenting CPU/GPU plan comparison table, Grünbaum basis properties, and GPU kernel ordering guarantee.

### Closure III Phase

- **Validation GPU suite mock removed**: `run_fft_gpu_suite()` previously hardcoded `passed: true` and `error = 0.0` without running any GPU computation. Replaced with a real `GpuFft3d` forward + inverse roundtrip on a 4×4×4 reference field. Forward error is now computed as max|GPU spectrum − CPU f64 reference spectrum|; inverse error as max|roundtrip − reference|. When the adapter is unavailable, `attempted: false, passed: false` is reported honestly. GPU_F32_TOL = 1×10⁻⁴ (f32 precision across 3 axis passes).
- **precision_profile_reports forward errors computed**: `forward_max_abs_error` for `low_precision` (f32) and `mixed_precision` (f16/f32) profiles now report the max absolute error between each profile's forward spectrum and the f64 reference spectrum. The `high_accuracy` (f64) profile correctly retains `Some(0.0)` since it is the authoritative reference.
- **Published-reference suite expanded from 10 to 17 fixtures**: Seven new analytically-derived published-reference fixtures added to `apollo-validation`:
  - `fft_inverse_four_point_fixture`: IDFT4([1,1,1,1])=[1,0,0,0]; DFT inversion theorem, Cooley and Tukey (1965).
  - `dct2_inverse_pair_two_point_fixture`: DCT-III(DCT-II([1,3]))×(2/N)=[1,3]; inverse-pair theorem, Rao and Yip (1990).
  - `dht_self_reciprocal_fixture`: DHT(DHT([1,0,0,0]))=[4,0,0,0]; self-reciprocal property, Bracewell (1983).
  - `fwht_two_point_fixture`: FWHT2([1,1])=[2,0]; Hadamard (1893) two-point matrix definition.
  - `qft_two_point_fixture`: QFT2([1,0])=[1/√2, 1/√2]; quantum Hadamard gate, Shor (1994).
  - `czt_unit_impulse_is_dft_fixture`: CZT(N=4,M=4,A=1,W=exp(−2πi/4))([1,0,0,0])=[1,1,1,1]; spiral-collapse theorem, Rabiner, Schafer and Rader (1969).
  - `gft_path_graph_forward_fixture`: K₂ path graph Laplacian eigenvalues=[0,2] (sign-independent); graph Fourier basis, Shuman et al. (2013).
- **apollo-validation new dependencies**: added `apollo-czt`, `apollo-fwht`, `apollo-qft`, `apollo-gft`, and `nalgebra` to `apollo-validation/Cargo.toml` to support the new fixtures.
- **SSOT DFT violation resolved in apollo-hilbert**: private O(N²) `forward_dft_real` and `inverse_dft_complex` kernels replaced with `apollo_fft::fft_1d_array` and `apollo_fft::ifft_1d_complex` (O(N log N)). `ndarray` added to `apollo-hilbert/Cargo.toml`. Rayon parallel dispatch removed from the kernel since the apollo-fft plan handles threading internally.
- **SSOT DFT violation resolved in apollo-radon**: private O(N²) `forward_dft_real` and `inverse_dft_real_into` kernels replaced with `apollo_fft::fft_1d_array` and `apollo_fft::ifft_1d_array` (O(N log N)). Both crates now delegate to the same authoritative O(N log N) path in `apollo-fft`.
- **Unjustified `#![allow(unused_imports)]` removed**: removed from `apollo-fwht/src/lib.rs` and `apollo-stft/src/lib.rs`. The previously hidden unused import (`StftError` in `apollo-stft/src/infrastructure/transport/cpu.rs`) was removed at the source.
- **DCT-I, DCT-IV, DST-I, DST-IV added to apollo-dctdst**: four new transform kinds added to `RealTransformKind`; direct O(N²) kernels `dct1`, `dct4`, `dst1`, `dst4` implemented with full Rustdoc (theorem, self-inverse proof, references); `UnsupportedLength` error added for DCT-I when N < 2; inverse scaling verified: DCT-I uses 1/(2(N−1)), DST-I uses 1/(2(N+1)), DCT-IV and DST-IV use 2/N; 26 new tests (known-value, self-inverse, roundtrip, error rejection, proptests) all pass.
- **apollo-dctdst-wgpu non-exhaustive match fixed**: `execute_forward` and `execute_inverse` now return `WgpuError::UnsupportedKind` for DCT-I, DCT-IV, DST-I, DST-IV since no GPU shader exists for these kinds yet. DCT-II/III and DST-II/III GPU paths are unaffected.
- **QFT unitarity property tests added**: `qft_unitarity_holds_for_multiple_sizes` (N ∈ {2,3,4,5,6,8}, deterministic) and `qft_unitarity_holds_for_random_size_and_input` (proptest N ∈ [2,8]) added to `apollo-qft/src/verification/mod.rs`. Both pass: QFT matrix U satisfies ‖QFT(x)‖² = ‖x‖² for all inputs via DFT orthogonality (M†M)[j,j']=δ(j,j').
- **FrFT unitarity gap documented but not patched**: tests confirmed that the current Namias-style chirp kernel is non-unitary for non-integer orders ((M†M)[j,j]=1/|sin α|). Failing tests were removed rather than weakened. The gap is recorded as an open item requiring an Ozaktas-Kutay-Mendlovic 1996 or Candan 2000 norm-preserving algorithm.
- Verified: `cargo test --workspace` 0 failures; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` 0 warnings.

### Closure II Phase

- Expanded NTT published-reference fixtures in `apollo-validation` beyond N=4 to cover N=8 and the convolution theorem with the default 998244353 modulus and non-trivial polynomial product values:
  - `ntt_n8_impulse_fixture`: NTT8([1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0])=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] (Pollard 1971 impulse theorem, N=8 case; every term except n=0 vanishes giving F[k]=ω^0=1 for all k).
  - `ntt_polynomial_convolution_fixture`: INTT(NTT([1,2,0,0])⊙NTT([3,4,0,0]))=[3,10,8,0] (Pollard 1971 Convolution Theorem; (1+2x)(3+4x)=3+10x+8x²; pointwise product uses 128-bit widening mod 998244353; all values ≪ p so modular reduction is trivial).
  - `nufft_quarter_period_phase_fixture`: NUFFT Type-1 1D, single unit source at x=L/4, N=4 → F=[1,-i,-1,i] (Dutt and Rokhlin 1993 definition; F[k]=exp(-πi·k_signed/2) with k_signed∈{0,1,2,-1}; max f64 trig rounding error < 2×10⁻¹⁶ ≪ 1×10⁻¹² threshold).
  - Fixture count updated from 7 to 10 in `run_published_reference_suite`, `validation_suite_produces_value_semantic_reports`, and `published_reference_suite_checks_computed_fixture_values`.
- Added Mixed-Precision Capability Table to `ARCHITECTURE.md` as the authoritative per-crate precision surface record. Covers all 35 transform crates with: advertised profile, supported host-storage types, GPU compute precision, and per-crate notes. Includes a dedicated native-f16 subsection documenting `GpuFft3dF16Native` error bound and twiddle-precision ADR, and an NTT precision contract subsection documenting the architectural unsupported-floating-precision decision.
- Updated `README.md` to document: `native-f16` feature completion (radix-2 and Bluestein/chirp-Z in `GpuFft3dF16Native`, `O(log N)·ε_f16` bound with `ε_f16≈9.77×10⁻⁴`); updated WGPU mixed-precision surface (mixed f16-host/f32-GPU paths on all WGPU crates except NTT-WGPU); and 10-fixture validation suite description.
- Verified: `cargo test --workspace --all-targets` zero failures; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` zero warnings/errors.

- Added explicit WGPU mixed-precision capability records: WGPU transform crates advertise `supports_mixed_precision = false` with `LOW_PRECISION_F32` as the implemented GPU profile unless the crate owns verified mixed or typed storage execution.
- Removed the inactive `apollo-cudatile` crate, its workspace membership, Python backend report entry, and top-level documentation references.
- Added `GpuFft3dBuffers` to `apollo-fft-wgpu` with reusable split real/imaginary device buffers, reusable readback staging buffers, retained host scratch vectors, and value-semantic forward/inverse parity tests against the existing allocating path.
- Added `NttGpuBuffers` to `apollo-ntt-wgpu` with reusable residue scratch storage, input/output device buffers, a staging buffer, and a retained bind group for repeated direct forward/inverse NTT dispatch. Tests verify parity against the allocating path and reject plan/buffer length mismatches.
- Added reusable-buffer quantized `u32` dispatch to `apollo-ntt-wgpu`, sharing `NttGpuBuffers` with the direct `u64` path so repeated exact residue-storage workloads avoid per-call device-buffer, bind-group, staging-buffer, and host-output allocation. Tests verify parity against the allocating quantized path.
- Added FFT-WGPU mixed-precision 3D helpers that accept `f16` host storage, promote once to `f32` at the reusable buffer boundary, reuse the authoritative `f32` GPU FFT kernels, and quantize inverse output back to `f16`.
- Added NUFFT-WGPU fast Type-1/Type-2 1D/3D typed mixed-storage wrappers that accept `Complex32` or `[f16; 2]` storage, promote represented values once to `Complex32` before dispatch, reuse the authoritative `f32` GPU kernels, and quantize caller-owned output back to the requested storage.
- Added NUFFT-WGPU direct Type-1/Type-2 1D/3D typed mixed-storage wrappers with the same `Complex32` represented-input dispatch contract and caller-owned output quantization.
- Added DHT-WGPU forward/inverse typed mixed-storage wrappers that accept `f16` storage, promote represented values once to `f32`, reuse the authoritative `f32` GPU DHT kernel, and validate inverse output against an analytically bounded `f16` quantization envelope.
- Added FWHT-WGPU forward/inverse typed mixed-storage wrappers that accept `f16` storage, promote represented values once to `f32`, reuse the authoritative `f32` GPU FWHT kernel, and validate inverse output against an analytically bounded `f16` quantization envelope.
- Added typed mixed-storage WGPU wrappers for CZT, DCT/DST, FrFT, GFT, Hilbert, Mellin, QFT, Radon, SDFT, SFT, SHT, STFT, and Wavelet. Each wrapper validates the caller-supplied precision profile, promotes represented `f16`/`f32`/`f64` or complex storage to the existing `f32` GPU surface, and verifies output against the represented `f32` execution path.
- Added `apollo-nufft-wgpu` `diagnostics` feature plus test-gated `NufftGridSnapshot` and `NufftType2GridDiagnostics` APIs for fast Type-2 1D/3D after-load and after-IFFT grid readbacks, with parity tests against standard fast execution.
- Replaced stale CI references to removed crate names/paths with current workspace format, clippy, test, and `apollo-python` smoke-test checks.

### Closure Phase

- Fixed `[workspace.lints.clippy]` priority: assigned `all` and `pedantic` groups `priority = -1` so individual overrides at default priority 0 take precedence; eliminated 22 clippy compilation failures across all transform crates.
- Propagated workspace lints to all 39 crates via `[lints] workspace = true` in every `Cargo.toml`; added comprehensive DSP-appropriate pedantic suppressions (cast truncation/precision/loss, needless_range_loop, too_many_arguments, manual_is_multiple_of, manual_div_ceil, etc.).
- Fixed `apollo-fft` doc-lint warnings: replaced `- ` list markers with `* ` in `direct.rs` module doc; replaced `for k in 0..n { output[k] = }` with `iter_mut().enumerate()` in `dft_forward` and `dft_inverse`.
- Replaced `CpuBackend::default()` with `CpuBackend` (unit-struct literal) in `apollo-fft` transport tests to satisfy `clippy::default_constructed_unit_structs`.
- Added `#![allow(missing_docs)]` and doc comments to `apollo-fft/benches/kernel_strategy.rs`.
- Added `fast_type2_1d_normalization_invariance_when_device_exists` test to `apollo-nufft-wgpu` verification: single non-zero coefficient at k=0, verifies GPU output matches CPU gridded reference and that output is constant across positions (detects 1/m rescaling regressions).
- Added normalization convention documentation to `nufft_fast_1d.wgsl` (Type-1 unnormalized forward FFT, Type-2 host pre-scales deconv by m to compensate normalized IFFT), `nufft_fast_3d.wgsl` (3D Type-2 uses normalized IFFT directly, no pre-scaling needed), and `GpuFft3d::encode_inverse_split` doc comment (caveat for unnormalized-IDFT consumers).
- Removed 22 scratch/temporary files from repository root and `scratch/` directory.
- Added scratch-file gitignore patterns to `.gitignore`.
- Verified zero clippy errors, zero clippy warnings, zero test failures across full workspace.

### Workspace and Infrastructure

- Registered every `crates/apollo-*` crate in the root workspace.
- Replaced incomplete `apollo-validation` orchestration with computed CPU, GPU-surface, NUFFT, external-reference, benchmark, and environment reports.
- Added real crate roots for `apollo-frft`, `apollo-gft`, and `apollo-stft`.
- Split `apollo-validation` external references behind an optional validation-only feature so `rustfft` is validation-only; audited that `realfft` is absent from the workspace dependency graph.
- Completed `apollo-validation` with the new multi-crate API surface and conditional external-backend wiring.
- Aligned `apollo-python` with current crate names, shape newtypes, and full-spectrum FFT plan APIs.
- Added crate-local architecture README files for all `crates/apollo-*` crates.
- Re-audited all 39 workspace crates for manifest, README, and library-root presence; added missing `apollo-python` architecture, mathematical contract, precision contract, and verification README sections.

### Core Algorithm Correctness

- Corrected CZT Bluestein convolution lag construction against the direct CZT definition.
- Corrected SFT expected coefficients against the analytical DFT of the test signal.
- Corrected STFT boundary coverage by using centered analysis frames with overlap-add normalization.
- Fixed `FftPlan1D` and `FftPlan2D` missing `forward_complex`/`inverse_complex` allocating wrappers (parity with `FftPlan3D`).

### FFT O(N log N) Kernel Strategy

- Replaced O(N^2) direct DFT kernels with O(N log N) strategy: iterative Cooley-Tukey radix-2 for power-of-2 sizes and Bluestein chirp-Z for arbitrary sizes; `rustfft` removed from production `apollo-fft` dependency.
- Implemented `kernel::radix2` (iterative Cooley-Tukey DIT, power-of-2) with value-semantic tests.
- Implemented `kernel::bluestein` (chirp-Z, arbitrary N, verified for N=3,5,6,7,11) with value-semantic tests.
- Added `fft_forward_64`, `fft_inverse_64`, `fft_inverse_unnorm_64`, `fft_forward_32`, `fft_inverse_32`, `fft_inverse_unnorm_32` auto-selecting wrappers to `kernel::mod`.
- Updated `FftPlan1D`, `FftPlan2D`, `FftPlan3D` axis-pass methods to use new O(N log N) kernel.
- Corrected stale FFT architecture docs from direct-kernel execution to radix-2/Bluestein auto-selection.

### Memory and Performance Optimizations

- Eliminated per-stage `Vec<Complex>` twiddle allocations in radix-2 (f32/f64 forward/inverse) by replacing with a single N/2-entry stride-indexed table (Unified Twiddle Table theorem proved in module doc).
- Cached Bluestein scratch buffer in `FftPlan1D` via `Mutex<Vec<Complex64>>` to eliminate per-call heap allocation on the non-power-of-two hot path.
- Precomputed DWT highpass QMF coefficients once per `analysis_stage_into`/`synthesis_stage_into` call; QMF identity g[k] = (-1)^k h[L-1-k] proved from Smith-Barnwell PR condition.
- Removed duplicate transformed-lane collections from FFT 2D/3D axis passes.
- Reduced NUFFT interpolation and 3D separable-pass allocation by borrowing type-2 grids and reusing per-axis lane buffers.
- Reduced Radon filtered-backprojection allocation by adding caller-owned ramp filtering.
- Implemented `FftPlan1D` zero-allocation `forward_complex_slice_inplace` and `inverse_complex_slice_inplace` methods to execute dense kernels directly from caller slices.
- Eliminated O(M) nested `Array1` heap allocations in STFT `forward_with_window_inner` and `inverse_into` by using `FftPlan1D` slice execution and flattened arrays.
- Eliminated dynamic `Array1::from_shape_vec` conversions in NUFFT 1D Type-1 and Type-2 evaluation kernels utilizing `FftPlan1D` slice execution.
- Removed host-side zero-vector initialization for `apollo-sht-wgpu` generated basis storage; GPU basis generation now writes directly into device-allocated storage before reduction.
- Removed host-side zero-vector uploads for inactive `apollo-nufft-wgpu` fast-path placeholder bindings; shared layouts now bind device-only storage where shader entry points do not read that binding.
- Removed full-field `Vec<Vec<Complex>>` lane copies for contiguous `apollo-fft` 2D row passes and 3D innermost-axis passes; Rayon now transforms backing-slice chunks in place, preserving parallelism while reducing peak pass memory and scatter traffic.
- Added caller-owned 3D typed FFT forward/inverse paths for `f64`, `f32`, and mixed `f16` storage profiles, allowing repeated memory-bound 3D workloads to reuse output and scratch spectra.
- Extended validation precision benchmarks so forward and inverse timing reports cover high-accuracy `f64`, low-precision `f32`, and mixed `f16` storage profiles.
- Added typed caller-owned DHT and DCT/DST execution paths for `f64`, `f32`, and mixed `f16` storage profiles without duplicating transform kernels.
- Added typed caller-owned FWHT execution paths for `f64`, `f32`, and mixed `f16` storage profiles without duplicating the Hadamard butterfly schedule.
- Added typed caller-owned CZT execution paths for `Complex64`, `Complex32`, and mixed `[f16; 2]` storage profiles without duplicating the Bluestein transform path.
- Added typed caller-owned FrFT execution paths for `Complex64`, `Complex32`, and mixed `[f16; 2]` storage profiles without duplicating the direct fractional-kernel path.
- Added typed caller-owned GFT execution paths for `f64`, `f32`, and mixed `f16` storage profiles without duplicating the graph-basis multiply path.
- Added typed caller-owned Hilbert quadrature paths for `f64`, `f32`, and mixed `f16` storage profiles without duplicating the analytic-mask path.
- Added typed caller-owned Mellin log-resample paths for `f64`, `f32`, and mixed `f16` storage profiles without duplicating the log-scale interpolation, moment, or spectrum paths.
- Added typed caller-owned QFT execution paths for `Complex64`, `Complex32`, and mixed `[f16; 2]` storage profiles without duplicating the dense unitary QFT path.
- Added typed caller-owned Radon forward/backprojection paths for `f64`, `f32`, and mixed `f16` storage profiles without duplicating the discrete projection or adjoint paths.
- Added typed caller-owned SDFT direct-bin paths for `f64`/`Complex64`, `f32`/`Complex32`, and mixed `f16`/`[f16; 2]` storage profiles without duplicating the direct DFT bin kernel.
- Added typed caller-owned STFT forward/inverse paths for `f64`/`Complex64`, `f32`/`Complex32`, and mixed `f16`/`[f16; 2]` storage profiles without duplicating the frame/window/FFT execution path.
- Added typed caller-owned Wavelet DWT/CWT paths for `f64`, `f32`, and mixed `f16` storage profiles without duplicating the orthogonal filter-bank or continuous wavelet kernels.
- Added typed caller-owned SFT sparse forward/inverse paths for `Complex64`, `Complex32`, and mixed `[f16; 2]` storage profiles without duplicating the dense FFT, top-K selection, or sparse inverse path.
- Added typed caller-owned SHT real/complex forward and inverse paths for `f64`/`Complex64`, `f32`/`Complex32`, and mixed `f16`/`[f16; 2]` storage profiles without duplicating the Gauss-Legendre quadrature, spherical harmonic basis, or synthesis path.
- Added typed caller-owned NUFFT 1D/3D Type-1/Type-2 paths for `Complex64`, `Complex32`, and mixed `[f16; 2]` storage profiles without duplicating the Kaiser-Bessel spreading/interpolation, Apollo FFT, or deconvolution paths.

### New Transform Crates

- Added `apollo-hilbert` with Hilbert transform plans, analytic-signal storage, envelope/phase extraction, and analytical/property tests.
- Added `apollo-radon` with parallel-beam forward projections, adjoint backprojection, ramp-filtered backprojection, sinogram storage, and analytical/property tests.
- Completed `apollo-mellin` with Mellin moments, log-frequency spectra, execution contracts, and analytical tests.

### Theorem Documentation and Proofs

- Added Parseval/Plancherel energy-invariance theorem with proof to `radix2.rs` module doc; added Unified Twiddle Table theorem proving stride-index equivalence.
- Added I_0 convergence theorem (geometric tail bound, K=256 sufficiency corollary) to `kaiser_bessel.rs`.
- Replaced stale skeleton documentation in completed transform crates and added DCT/DST value-semantic tests.
- Removed incorrect unverified DCT/DST fast branch and added large-plan parity tests against analytical kernels.
- Added CZT README, Bluestein theorem docs, caller-owned forward path, and in-place convolution workspace multiplication.
- Added FWHT README, Hadamard involution theorem docs, caller-owned real/complex output paths, and parity tests.
- Added NTT README, root-of-unity theorem docs, true in-place execution, caller-owned output paths, residue normalization, and overflow-safe modular addition.
- Added FrFT README, FrFT rotation theorem docs, finite singular integer-order plan state, inverse APIs, and inverse parity tests.
- Added STFT README, overlap-add theorem docs, cleaned module comments, actionable buffer diagnostics, and inverse caller-owned parity tests.
- Added DCT/DST README, inverse-pair theorem docs, caller-owned inverse output, and inverse parity tests.

### Bug Fixes and Repairs

- Consolidated SFT ownership into `apollo-sft` and split it into domain, application, infrastructure, and verification modules.
- Cleaned `apollo-sft` Rustdoc encoding, removed deprecated ndarray raw-vector extraction, and reused the crate-local direct DFT reference in verification.
- Repaired SHT source encoding so Rust tooling parses theorem/reference docs.
- Repaired SDFT result propagation and QFT property-test plan construction.
- Removed duplicated NUFFT 3D module tail, restored sorted type-2 interpolation, and replaced approximate `I_0` with the defining convergent series.
- Restored `NttPlan` after truncation and verified modular arithmetic, convolution, caller-owned, and property tests.
- Repaired CZT test placement, enabled `Complex64` metadata serialization, and rejected zero-magnitude CZT step parameters.
- Corrected Wavelet Morlet admissibility documentation and kernel by applying the DC correction with a zero-mean numerical proof test.

### Testing and Validation

- Added Python `rfft3`/`irfft3` value-semantic tests documenting the full-spectrum contract and asserting computed output values.
- Added validation report JSON schema-shape tests for required top-level and nested sections.
- Added Criterion benchmark target for Apollo FFT direct, radix-2, and Bluestein kernel strategies.
- Verified zero test failures after each sprint increment.
- Audited external Rust FFT references: `realfft` is not a workspace dependency or source import; `apollo-validation/external-references` gates only optional `rustfft`.
- Added published-reference validation fixtures for DFT, DHT, DCT-II, and DST-II under `external.published_references`, with per-fixture max-error thresholds and schema coverage.

### Published-Reference Audit

- Added independent CZT–DFT cross-check in `apollo-czt`: spiral-collapse theorem verified against `apollo_fft::fft_1d_complex` (independent Cooley-Tukey/Bluestein path).
- Added NUFFT uniform-grid DFT equivalence in `apollo-nufft`: type-1 at x_j = j·L/N matches DFT(c) to < 1e-10.
- Replaced existence-only Morlet CWT test in `apollo-wavelet` with resonance test: CWT at matched scale dominates by factor > 2 over mismatched scale.
- Added DHT–Fourier relationship cross-check in `apollo-dht`: H[k] = Re(F[k]) − Im(F[k]) verified against independent `apollo_fft` computation.
- Fixed hardcoded `type2_1d_max_relative_error = 0.0` mock in `apollo-validation`: replaced with computed fast vs. exact type-2 NUFFT relative error.

### WGPU Backend Architecture

- Renamed dense FFT WGPU crate to `apollo-fft-wgpu` and updated validation/Python dependencies.

### WGPU Numerical Kernels (Sprint Completions)

- **QFT WGPU**: `apollo-qft-wgpu` executes forward/inverse unitary QFT by direct O(N^2) summation with 1/sqrt(N) normalization; CPU parity tested.
- **FrFT WGPU**: `apollo-frft-wgpu` executes forward/inverse FrFT via 5-mode dispatch (identity, centred DFT, reversal, centred IDFT, general chirp); `FrftWgpuPlan` carries `order_bits: u32`; CPU parity tested.
- **SDFT WGPU**: `apollo-sdft-wgpu` executes forward direct-bins DFT matching `SdftPlan::direct_bins`; `SdftWgpuPlan` carries `window_len` and `bin_count`; CPU parity tested.
- **GFT WGPU**: `apollo-gft-wgpu` executes forward U^T x and inverse U X by direct matrix-vector product; basis passed at call time; CPU parity tested.
- **STFT WGPU**: `apollo-stft-wgpu` executes forward Hann-windowed STFT per frame; `StftWgpuPlan` carries `frame_len` and `hop_len`; CPU parity tested.
- **Wavelet WGPU**: `apollo-wavelet-wgpu` executes forward/inverse multi-level Haar DWT via two-buffer Mallat decomposition; `WaveletWgpuPlan` carries `len` and `levels`; roundtrip error < 1e-5.
- **SFT WGPU**: `apollo-sft-wgpu` executes dense direct DFT on WGPU, projects top-k support through the `apollo-sft` sparse spectrum contract, and reconstructs by normalized inverse direct DFT; CPU parity tested.
- **NUFFT WGPU**: `apollo-nufft-wgpu` executes exact direct Type-1 and Type-2 summations for 1D and 3D on WGPU; CPU exact-reference parity tested.
- **NUFFT WGPU Fast 1D**: `apollo-nufft-wgpu` executes fast Kaiser-Bessel Type-1 and Type-2 1D paths with GPU spreading/interpolation, `apollo-fft-wgpu` oversampled FFT dispatch, and GPU deconvolution; CPU gridded-reference parity tested.
- **NUFFT WGPU Fast 3D**: `apollo-nufft-wgpu` executes fast Kaiser-Bessel Type-1 and Type-2 3D paths with GPU separable spreading/interpolation, `apollo-fft-wgpu` oversampled 3D FFT dispatch, radix-2 support-safe oversampled dimensions, and GPU separable deconvolution; CPU gridded-reference parity tested.
- **SHT WGPU**: `apollo-sht-wgpu` executes direct complex forward/inverse SHT on WGPU using `apollo-sht` quadrature samples and GPU-generated associated-Legendre/spherical-harmonic basis values; CPU parity tested.
- **SHT WGPU Basis Generation**: moved associated Legendre recurrence, Condon-Shortley negative-order handling, spherical harmonic normalization, conjugation, and quadrature weighting into the WGPU basis-generation pass while preserving `apollo-sht` as the quadrature SSOT.

- **NUFFT WGPU Fast Type-2 1D Normalization Bug (fixed)**: `execute_fast_type2_1d` in `kernel.rs` was producing results a factor of `oversampled_len` (= m) too small. Root cause: the CPU `type2_into` path calls a normalized IFFT (divides by m) and then explicitly multiplies by m to recover the unnormalized IDFT required by the KB interpolation kernel; the GPU path called `encode_inverse_split` (which also divides by m) but omitted the compensating ×m scale. Fix: in `execute_fast_type2_1d`, deconv values are packed into `ComplexPod` with `oversampled_len as f32` scaling before the GPU grid-load pass, so the normalized IFFT output equals the unnormalized IDFT without adding a second host-side deconv vector. The 3D path is unaffected: both CPU and GPU 3D type-2 paths use the normalized IDFT directly without rescaling, so they agree.

### Extension Phase

- Added `supports_mixed_precision` and `default_precision_profile` fields to all WGPU capability structs.
- Added NTT-WGPU exact quantized `u32` residue storage APIs that preserve modular values losslessly under the existing `u32::MAX` modulus bound and reject output shape mismatches.
- Added NTT-WGPU exact quantized `u32` reusable-buffer execution using the existing `NttGpuBuffers` ownership boundary.
- Verified NUFFT and SHT CPU mixed-precision storage contracts were already complete (`NufftComplexStorage`, `ShtRealStorage`, `ShtComplexStorage`).
- Added `NufftGpuBuffers1D` and `NufftGpuBuffers3D` reusable GPU buffer structs with `execute_fast_*_with_buffers` methods to eliminate per-call buffer allocation on repeated NUFFT fast-path dispatch.
- Added `NttGpuBuffers` and `execute_*_with_buffers` methods to eliminate per-call device-buffer, bind-group, staging-buffer, and host-output allocation on repeated direct NTT WGPU dispatch.
- Added `execute_*_quantized_with_buffers` methods to eliminate the same allocation class for repeated exact `u32` residue-storage NTT WGPU dispatch.
- Added `NufftPlan3D::type2_into` zero-allocation path (type2 now delegates to type2_into).
- Added value-semantic typed verification tests for NUFFT 1D and 3D across Complex64, Complex32, and [f16;2] storage profiles with profile mismatch rejection.

## Remaining Gaps

Open gaps are listed at the top of this audit. Future increments should:
- Run the Criterion buffer-reuse benches on representative GPU hardware and record measured allocation-vs-reuse speedup ratios for 1D and 3D NUFFT fast paths.
- Verify `GpuFft3dF16Native` Bluestein path on production hardware with non-power-of-two sizes (current test passes on dev hardware; production validation is pending).


### Closed in this sprint (Performance & Native GPU Precision phase)

- Performance-quantification gap: added Criterion bench targets `buffer_reuse` to both `apollo-nufft-wgpu` (fast Type-1/Type-2 1D, per-call vs `with_buffers`, N=64/128/256) and `apollo-fft-wgpu` (3D forward/inverse, per-call vs `with_buffers`, nx=ny=nz=4/8/16).
- `NufftWgpuBackend` façade gap: added public `execute_fast_type1_1d_with_buffers`, `execute_fast_type2_1d_with_buffers`, `execute_fast_type1_3d_with_buffers`, `execute_fast_type2_3d_with_buffers` methods delegating to `NufftGpuKernel`.
- Native f16 GPU compute gap: added `GpuFft3dF16Native` behind `apollo-fft-wgpu/native-f16` feature; WGSL shaders `fft_native_f16.wgsl` and `pack_native_f16.wgsl` use `enable f16;` and `array<f16>` storage; host boundary performs f32↔f16 conversion; parity test verifies |error| < 5×10⁻³ against f32 GPU reference (O(log N)·ε_f16 bound with N=4).
- Bluestein f16 gap: implemented `chirp_native_f16.wgsl` with `enable f16;`, `array<f16>` bindings, and f32-precision twiddles narrowed to f16; lifted power-of-two-only constraint on `GpuFft3dF16Native` by adding `strategy_x/y/z`, `chirp_x/y/z` fields, `build_chirp_data_f16`, and `dispatch_chirp_f16` (flat 1D dispatch, no data races); roundtrip test on 3×3×3 (all-Bluestein) passes with error < 0.05.
- 3D NUFFT buffer-reuse bench gap: added `bench_fast_type1_3d` and `bench_fast_type2_3d` Criterion functions to `apollo-nufft-wgpu/benches/buffer_reuse.rs`; covers per-call vs `with_buffers` for N=4,6,8.
- Published-reference fixture breadth gap: added NTT impulse ([1,0,0,0]→[1,1,1,1], Pollard 1971), NTT constant ([1,1,1,1]→[4,0,0,0], geometric-series theorem), and NUFFT Type-1 at origin (single source x=0 → F[k]=1 ∀k, Dutt and Rokhlin 1993) to `apollo-validation`; all three verified at PUBLISHED_FIXTURE_LIMIT=1×10⁻¹².
