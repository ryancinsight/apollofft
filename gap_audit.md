# Apollo Gap Audit

## Closed Gaps

- Closure CVXII narrows the reduced f32 Winograd-pair layout to DFT31 after
  measuring and rejecting the broader N=29/37/41/53 reduced route. The retained
  path stores pair sums and imaginary differences in separate scalar arrays and
  accumulates the DC bin during the pair pass, while all f64 routes and f32
  N=11/13/17/19/23/29/37/41/43/47/53 remain on the generic Winograd-pair
  kernel. Direct-DFT coverage now checks promoted f64 odd-prime routes, all
  f32 odd-prime routes, and the reduced f32 DFT31 inverse route. Current
  optimized clone-inclusive rows record reduced f32 DFT31 at 87.31 ns Apollo
  vs 83.75 ns RustFFT (`1.043x`), improving the direct generic-route probe of
  107.39 ns Apollo vs 82.46 ns RustFFT (`1.302x`) but leaving DFT31 open.

- Closure CVXI routes short odd-prime `ShortDft` sizes
  11/13/17/19/23/29/31/37/41/43/47/53 through the Winograd-pair kernel
  instead of static Rader. This removes the Rader convolution path from
  production short-prime leaves where the direct pair decomposition has lower
  constant cost. Generated static Rader coverage is retained and extended
  through N=53 for direct Rader/codegen verification. Focused direct value
  tests pass. Closure CVXII supersedes the f32 row inventory after the
  reduced-layout follow-up.

- Closure CVX removes the cached inverse-generator scatter table from runtime
  Rader and ordered-Rader Good-Thomas paths. The retained generator-order table
  stores `g^q`; scatter order is derived on demand by
  `g^{-q} = g^(N-1-q)` in the prime-order cyclic group. This removes one
  length-`N-1` `usize` allocation per cached prime/generator pair without
  changing Rader arithmetic. Direct identity coverage checks every primitive
  root table entry, and focused Rader plus Good-Thomas tests pass.

- Closure CVIX removes the temporary full `N-1` kernel from half-cyclic Rader
  spectrum construction. The cache builder now streams the two length-`m`
  halves directly into cyclic and negacyclic CRT residues, reducing peak
  construction storage from four `m`-length complex buffers to two and removing
  the split pass. Correctness is covered by forced half-cyclic/full-cyclic
  equivalence at N=521 and the full Rader-filtered test suite. The focused
  opt-level 1 Criterion rerun records N=1031 forced half-cyclic improvement,
  but release-quality O3 timing remains blocked by local codegen termination.

- Closure CVIII integrates half-cyclic Winograd/Liu-Tolimieri Rader
  convolution as a real production strategy and removes Apollo FFT Bluestein
  fallback references from the Rader/scalar routing surface. Correctness is
  covered by direct-DFT checks at N=521 for automatic, forced half-cyclic, and
  forced full-cyclic execution, plus the existing large-prime N=10007
  roundtrip. The production threshold is conservative at `N-1 >= 1024` for
  both f64 and f32 because focused optimized opt-level 1 Criterion rows show
  no amortization at N=521 and only parity-to-small gains at N=1031. A full O3
  bench-quick rerun remains blocked by local codegen termination, so a broader
  release-quality threshold sweep remains open before tightening this policy.

## Open Gaps

- After Closure CVXII, f32 short odd-prime rows
  N=11/13/17/19/29/31/37/41/53 still trail RustFFT despite improved timings.
  N=23/43/47 beat RustFFT through the generic Winograd-pair route. The
  remaining gap is inside the f32 Winograd-pair codegen/arithmetic path, not
  in static Rader dispatch.

- `benchmark_results.md` still contains measured rows where Apollo trails
  RustFFT. Editing the table without corresponding Criterion evidence is
  rejected as benchmark fabrication. Closure CVI adds generated N=18/N=24/N=36
  short Good-Thomas leaves and removes generic PFA column-buffer allocation,
  and `xtask benchmark` now has a quick Criterion/runtime profile plus
  `bench-quick` Cargo profile for iterative targeted refreshes. Closure CVII
  adds a macro-derived fixed coprime Good-Thomas support/match surface for
  canonical pairs up to N=200 backed by one bounded const-generic PFA codelet,
  then rejects full unrolled all-pair body emission because it exceeds the
  bounded bench/release compile budget. The remaining disparity is route cost,
  not trait-dispatch overhead: N=9 is a prime-power short leaf,
  N=84/N=90/N=150/N=175 use distinct fixed PFA factorizations, and N=94 uses
  the direct `2*p` route. A focused N=44 probe after fixed PFA routing records
  Apollo/RustFFT ratios of 1.541x f64 and 1.593x f32, so the row remains an
  open miss and `benchmark_results.md` was not rewritten from that probe. The
  prior N=10 f32 Apollo row was stale Criterion data; the focused refresh
  records f32 Apollo at 42.38 ns, consistent with the f64 row. Normal
  `xtask benchmark` execution now uses the optimized bounded adaptive
  clone-inclusive runner instead of a Criterion subprocess, while
  `--skip-run` remains a legacy Criterion JSON merge path. The already-built
  optimized `xtask` binary regenerated the full canonical table in 65.6
  seconds. N=77 was refreshed through the subset merge path and then the full
  table path; current N=77 records f64 Apollo/RustFFT at 1.923x and f32
  Apollo/RustFFT at 2.997x after the shared odd-prime-pair DFT11 const-loop
  improvement. The previous 4.739x f32 row was stale mixed-epoch evidence, but
  the remaining f32 miss is real and points to route-cost/vectorization work.
- Fresh targeted Criterion evidence for the restored power-of-two fast-path:
  focused correctness, `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`, and bench/example
  feature compile checks pass. `benchmark_results.md` was regenerated from the
  current Criterion cache. After the pre-existing writer finished, a targeted
  N=16 Criterion refresh exceeded the 300-second command cap, so dedicated
  post-cutoff rows for N=16/N=32/N=64/N=128/N=32768 remain pending. The current
  release quick comparison for N=16/N=32/N=64/N=128 records Apollo means of
  0.032/0.061/0.108/0.150 us versus RustFFT 0.032/0.041/0.064/0.106 us, so
  the cutoff improves Apollo's absolute route at 64/128 over the generic
  composite path but does not yet beat RustFFT at those sizes.
- Criterion/RustFFT benchmark evidence for the restored fused radix-composite
  dispatcher: compile and value-semantic verification pass. Bounded
  `APOLLO_FFT_BENCH_N=96` and `APOLLO_FFT_BENCH_N=192` `vs_rustfft` attempts
  exceeded their command caps before producing usable timing output, so fresh
  `vs_rustfft` or `prime_compose` numbers remain pending.
- Criterion Rader-vs-Winograd-pair evidence for N=29/N=31/N=37: both kernels
  compile and value-semantic equivalence passes against the direct DFT
  reference. The optimized Rader path has fused static gather/scatter and
  final-forward-stage pointwise fusion. Standalone Rader now also fuses the
  primitive-root gather with the nonzero DC sum and retains one Rader scratch
  buffer per precision instead of a two-buffer pool. Rader Bluestein now caches
  one forward kernel spectrum per prime/precision and derives inverse
  multiplication through conjugated SIMD pointwise execution instead of
  retaining a second spectrum. The N=29/N=31/N=37 Rader
  comparison leaves also use static gather/scatter permutation tables to remove runtime
  modular-index recurrence. Bounded strategy-only `quick_compare` now has
  debug Winograd/Rader ratios of 0.778/1.175 at N=29, 1.589/1.475 at N=31,
  and 0.783/2.494 at N=37 for f64/f32 after restoring the benchmark hook to
  compare the real Winograd-pair kernels against the shared generic Rader
  kernel. Release ratios remain pending after the benchmark-route correction.
  Ordered-layout Rader static/runtime kernels now remove standalone
  gather/scatter for fused callers that already produce generator-ordered
  nonzero inputs and consume inverse-generator-ordered nonzero outputs.
  Good-Thomas PFA now uses this ordered contract for prime `n1` subtransforms
  that would otherwise dispatch to Rader, folding the Rader input order into
  the transpose and the Rader output order into the CRT scatter. Direct-DFT
  checks cover N=38 forward and N=82 inverse, while N=29/N=31/N=37 remain on
  the measured Winograd-pair path. The ordered PFA branch now consumes the
  cached Rader generator/inverse-generator order arrays, so it no longer
  performs runtime modular index walks for the ordered transpose or final CRT
  scatter layout conversion. A dedicated two-by-prime path now bypasses this
  ordered-PFA shape for N=2p composites, and
  N=19/N=29/N=31/N=37/N=41/N=43/N=47/N=53 now use Winograd-pair prime leaves.
  The stale dedicated DFT-82 codelet was removed so N=82 falls through to the
  two-by-prime route. The direct N=2p promoted-prime branch now bypasses
  thread-local PFA scratch, even-half stack copying, and odd-half compaction by
  reading interleaved even/odd input directly inside the fused two-prime
  Winograd execution. Latest release two-by-prime ratios are 1.514, 1.195, 1.228,
  1.059, 1.025, 0.943, 0.587, and 0.757 for
  N=38/N=58/N=62/N=74/N=82/N=86/N=94/N=106. N=38 remains the largest bounded
  probe miss; N=58/N=62/N=74/N=82 remain marginal/noisy misses. Fresh
  quick-profile canonical `vs_rustfft` rows now include
  N=38/N=58/N=74/N=82/N=94 after the generated twiddle-free Good-Thomas
  direct path: N=38 remains a miss at 1.551x f64 and 1.695x f32, N=58 remains
  a miss at 1.207x f64 and 1.539x f32, N=74 remains a miss at 1.141x f64 and
  1.959x f32, N=82 remains a miss at 1.044x f64 and 1.532x f32, and N=94
  beats RustFFT at 0.746x f64 and 0.847x f32. N=74 f32 is the current largest
  direct `2*p` regression. Fresh Criterion `kernel_strategy` timing is still
  pending.
- `GpuFft3dF16Native` Bluestein path on production hardware with non-power-of-two sizes: current test passes on dev hardware; production validation on adapters that expose `wgpu::Features::SHADER_F16` is pending.
- Criterion buffer-reuse bench results on representative GPU hardware: allocation-vs-reuse speedup ratios for FFT/NUFFT/STFT/Radon WGPU benchmark suites are not yet recorded as numbers. Closure XXII added the manual self-hosted GPU workflow and runner script; the residual gap is the first benchmark execution on real labeled hardware and publication of the measured ratios.
- **NUFFT 2D CPU**: `apollo-nufft` has 1D and 3D; 2D separable NUFFT not yet implemented.
- **DWT 2D CPU**: `apollo-wavelet` has 1D DWT; 2D separable DWT not yet implemented.
- **GPU FFT 1D/2D**: `apollo-fft-wgpu` exposes 3D GPU FFT; 1D and 2D GPU FFT paths are absent.
- **FrFT 2D/3D**: `apollo-frft` has 1D only; 2D/3D separable fractional Fourier transform absent.
- **Hilbert inverse**: `apollo-hilbert` has 1D forward only; inverse (env. recovery) absent.
- **NTT 2D/3D**: `apollo-ntt` has 1D only; 2D/3D separable NTT absent.
- **STFT 2D**: `apollo-stft` / `apollo-stft-wgpu` are 1D only; 2D short-time FFT absent.
- **Mellin 2D/3D**: `apollo-mellin` has 1D only; 2D/3D separable Mellin transform absent.
- **SDFT inverse**: `apollo-sdft` and `apollo-sdft-wgpu` have forward only; inverse SDFT absent.
- **SFT 2D/3D**: `apollo-sft` has 1D only; 2D/3D SFT absent.
- **GFT 2D/3D**: `apollo-gft` has 1D only; 2D/3D GFT absent.
- **QFT 2D/3D**: `apollo-qft` has 1D only; 2D/3D QFT absent.
- **CZT 2D/3D**: `apollo-czt` has 1D only; 2D/3D CZT absent.
- **SHT 3D / Radon 3D**: `apollo-sht` has 2D only; `apollo-radon` has 2D only.

Note: NTT-WGPU floating mixed precision is an architectural design contract, not a gap.
Residue-field arithmetic requires exact modular integers; the WGPU surface uses exact `u32`
quantized storage (implemented and verified). Floating-point NTT is architecturally unsupported
by design and will not be implemented.

## Closed Gaps
### Closure CVII - Fixed Good-Thomas Macro Dispatch Review [patch]
- **Gap**: Fixed coprime PFA routes lacked a single generator-owned source of
  truth for broader canonical pairs, and benchmark-review rows were being
  interpreted as if monomorphization should make different factorizations
  share one kernel.
- **Closed by**: `generate_good_thomas_dispatch!` now derives canonical
  coprime pairs from `short_sizes` and `max_n`, emits the support/match
  surface for one bounded const-generic PFA body, and uses direct
  `ShortDft<N>` calls for generated row and column subtransforms. The partial
  `ShortDft` trait migration was completed by removing the
  `ShortWinogradScalar` cycle and restoring the `generate_winograd_fft!`
  export.
- **Residual risk**: N=77, N=84/N=90/N=175, and f32 N=150 remain slower than
  RustFFT. The next step is a route-cost model and f32 vectorization strategy
  that can prefer fixed PFA, mixed-radix, or direct `2*p` families by
  structural cost instead of adding size-specific bypasses. The N=10 f32
  disparity is closed as stale benchmark evidence, not a kernel defect.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft-macros`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-fft --lib`; `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --features
  kernel-strategy-bench`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft dft_composite_small_cases
  --lib`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft
  mixed_fixed_coprime_good_thomas_codelets_match_direct --lib`; `cargo test
  -p apollo-fft dft11 --lib`; `cargo run -p xtask -- benchmark --sizes 77
  --profile quick`; `target\bench-quick\xtask.exe benchmark --all --profile
  quick`.

### Closure CVI - Short Good-Thomas Codelets and PFA Scratch Reuse [patch]
- **Gap**: Several composite rows still route through generic composite/PFA
  machinery without a generated short leaf for reusable sublengths such as
  18, 24, and 36. Generic PFA also allocated a column `Vec` per transform.
- **Closed by**: Added generated `dft18_impl`, `dft24_impl`, and `dft36_impl`
  via `generate_good_thomas!` and routed them through `short_winograd`.
  Natural and ordered generic PFA split the existing thread-local PFA scratch
  into matrix and column-buffer regions, removing the per-call column `Vec`.
- **Residual risk**: The benchmark goal is not closed. A generated fixed
  coprime dispatcher for larger composite families needs a codegen-controlled
  design before it can be kept; the prototype was removed after optimized
  release bench builds failed to produce usable output within the bounded
  verification window.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft-macros`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-fft --lib`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib
  mixed_new_short_good_thomas_codelets_match_direct -- --test-threads=1`.

### Closure CV - Natural Good-Thomas and Generated Codelet Dispatch [patch]
- **Gap**: The generic natural Good-Thomas PFA kernel consumed the cached
  output CRT permutation through row-major `(k1, k2)` indexing even though the
  authoritative cache stores output indices by transformed column-major
  `(k2, k1)` coordinates. Compact generated `3*p` routes and direct `2*p`
  routes bypassed this path, leaving non-compact natural PFA correctness
  under-tested.
- **Closed by**: Natural PFA scatter now uses `output_perm[k2 * n1 + k1]`.
  Direct-DFT forward and unnormalized inverse tests cover a nontrivial
  coprime natural PFA shape through the private kernel, binding the table
  layout to computed values. A fresh rebuild also exposed stale Winograd
  const-generic direction call sites; generated Good-Thomas, production
  short-codelet dispatch, and unit tests now call the current `const INVERSE`
  DFT-3/7/8/15 entry points. The `3*p` Good-Thomas proc macro now emits direct
  const-generic DFT-3 column calls and direct row codelet calls from the single
  supported-prime list, removing the generated route's dependency on a
  separate short-codelet adapter.
- **Residual risk**: N=33/38/58/74/82 remain above RustFFT in the
  clone-inclusive Criterion table. N=94 beats RustFFT for both f64/f32 after
  the current route/codelet work. The next optimization target is shared
  two-by-prime and `3*p` row/column fusion that reduces stack row copies and
  scatter stores without deleting retained components. The active benchmark
  workflow is now one runner, `cargo run -p xtask -- benchmark`, and one output
  table, `benchmark_results.md`.
- **Evidence**: `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib natural_pfa_scatter --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib good_thomas --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-fft --lib dft_large -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft
  --lib dft_composite -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-fft-macros`; `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples
  --features kernel-strategy-bench`; targeted `vs_rustfft` Criterion refresh
  for N=33/38/58/74/82/94; `cargo run -p xtask -- benchmark --skip-run`;
  `git diff --check`.

### Closure CIV - Generated Good-Thomas Family Dispatch [patch]
- **Gap**: Good-Thomas macro generation still stopped at the `3*p` route
  boundary, and the direct `2*p` Winograd-pair path retained a local
  declarative dispatch macro. Release builds also did not expose the
  prime-pair module used by generated dispatch.
- **Closed by**: `generate_three_by_prime_dispatch!` now emits full per-prime
  `3*p` transform bodies. `generate_two_by_prime_natural_dispatch!` generates
  the direct `2*p` Winograd-pair dispatch from one table. `PrimePairTables` is
  part of the sealed Winograd scalar contract, and `odd_prime_pair` is visible
  to release builds. Benchmark hooks were restored against the same retained
  Winograd-pair implementation.
- **Residual risk**: N=33 still trails RustFFT, and N=38/N=58/N=74 remain
  misses in quick release timing. The next macro step should generate
  register-level Good-Thomas SSA kernels that fuse row transforms with final
  CRT scatter and should replace the direct generated Winograd prototype only
  after it beats the retained hand codelets.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft-macros`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-fft --lib`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib three_by_prime --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib two_by_prime --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib
  generated_rader_primes_match_direct_forward_and_inverse --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples
  --features kernel-strategy-bench`; release `quick_compare` for
  N=33/38/58/74/82/94; targeted Criterion N=33; `python
  extract_benchmarks.py`; `python -m py_compile extract_benchmarks.py`.

### Closure CIII - Generated Good-Thomas Route Fusion [patch]
- **Gap**: The prior proc-macro increment generated only support and dispatch
  arms. The hot `3*p` Good-Thomas path still used runtime CRT plan lookup and
  runtime short-codelet selection, while generated Rader code had mapping,
  precision, and inverse-symbol defects.
- **Closed by**: `generate_three_by_prime_dispatch!` now emits literal CRT
  gather/scatter functions per supported prime and threads those functions into
  the generic `three_by_prime_impl`. `short_winograd_const` provides const-size
  short-codelet dispatch. Generated Rader now follows the runtime
  generator/inverse-generator convention, emits exact f64 constants, and keeps
  inverse pointwise symbols in scope. Static Rader generation remains bounded to
  5/7/11/13 pending an O(N log N) generated convolution backend.
- **Residual risk**: N=33 still trails RustFFT in the Criterion table, and
  fresh release quick-compare rebuilding exceeded the 300-second cap. The next
  increment should reduce generated-code monomorphization and fuse the
  row-transform/scatter route into a register-level generated SSA kernel.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft-macros`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-fft --lib`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib three_by_prime --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib
  generated_rader_primes_match_direct_forward_and_inverse --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples
  --features kernel-strategy-bench`; `python extract_benchmarks.py`;
  `python -m py_compile extract_benchmarks.py`.

### Closure CII - Good-Thomas Proc-Macro Dispatch Generator [patch]
- **Gap**: The compact `3*p` Good-Thomas route had an intentionally repeated
  support predicate and `(P, inverse)` dispatch table after the const CRT plan
  landed. The root `gen*.md` notes call for generated routing surfaces so
  prime-family growth does not duplicate manually maintained dispatch arms.
- **Closed by**: Added the internal `apollo-fft-macros` proc-macro crate and
  replaced the hand-written `3*p` dispatch surface with
  `generate_three_by_prime_dispatch!`, driven by one short-prime list. The
  runtime kernel, `ThreeByPrimePlan<const P>`, and `MixedRadixScalar`
  monomorphization remain in `apollo-fft`.
- **Residual risk**: This generator emits the dispatch surface only. The
  physical row array and final CRT scatter remain runtime operations; the next
  generator step is route/load/store fusion using the same verified const CRT
  maps.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft-macros`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-fft --lib`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib three_by_prime --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples
  --features kernel-strategy-bench`; release `quick_compare` for
  N=21/33/39/51/69; `python extract_benchmarks.py`; `python -m py_compile
  extract_benchmarks.py`.

### Closure CI - Good-Thomas Const CRT Plan [patch]
- **Gap**: The compact `3*p` Good-Thomas path still computed modular inverses
  and CRT routes inside the transform implementation. The root `gen*.md`
  artifacts identify this as the stable layer that should move to const-time
  index derivation before a procedural macro emits SSA-routed code.
- **Closed by**: Added `ThreeByPrimePlan<const P>` with const-time CRT input
  and output maps for P=5/7/11/13/17/23. The `3*p` route now loads and stores
  through those monomorphized plans and retains the same `MixedRadixScalar`
  generic kernel body. Stockham scalar-reference tests were also made explicit
  about their fused-stage tile const parameters.
- **Residual risk**: This is a const-plan foundation, not a proc-macro SSA
  backend. Physical row arrays remain in the current runtime path; the next
  generator step is to emit straight-line route/load/store tokens for the same
  verified CRT maps.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft
  --lib three_by_prime -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p apollo-fft
  --benches --examples --features kernel-strategy-bench`; release
  `quick_compare` for N=21/33/39/51/69; targeted Criterion rows for N=33 f64
  and f32; `python extract_benchmarks.py`; `python -m py_compile
  extract_benchmarks.py`.

### Closure C - Three-By-Prime Good-Thomas Routing [patch]
- **Gap**: N=33 (`3*11`) had a coprime twiddle-free decomposition, but
  `dispatch_inplace` reached `cached_prime23_radices` first and executed the
  mixed-radix composite `[11, 3]` route. That route performed the generic
  twiddle-bearing composite pass structure for a size that can be expressed as
  a compact Good-Thomas CRT codelet.
- **Closed by**: Added `good_thomas::three_by_prime`, a reusable compact
  CRT implementation for `3*p` where `p` is one of the existing short prime
  codelets 5/7/11/13/17/23. The dispatcher now sends only this verified
  structural family to Good-Thomas before prime-23 composite routing. The
  benchmark-only ordered-Rader exports were also aligned with
  `rader_ordered_impl`.
- **Residual risk**: N=33 remains slower than RustFFT in the canonical
  clone-inclusive table. Adjacent misses such as N=35 and N=42 require the same
  structural treatment for broader coprime products rather than a size-specific
  branch.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft
  --lib mixed_three_by_prime -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p apollo-fft
  --benches --examples --features kernel-strategy-bench`; release
  `quick_compare` for N=21/22/26/33/34/35/39/42/46/51/69; `APOLLO_FFT_BENCH_N=33
  cargo bench -p apollo-fft --bench vs_rustfft --features kernel-strategy-bench
  -- apollo_fft_vs_rustfft`; `python extract_benchmarks.py`; `python -m
  py_compile extract_benchmarks.py`.

### Closure XCIX - Typed Real-Storage Direct Fill [patch]
- **Gap**: Typed real-storage caller-owned paths allocated mapped temporary
  arrays for real-to-complex fill and complex-to-real extraction before
  assigning into caller-owned buffers. Allocating typed forward paths also
  cloned the mapped complex array before execution.
- **Closed by**: Added shared direct-fill helpers over ndarray dimensions and
  routed f64/f32/f16 `forward_*_into` and `inverse_*_into` through one
  `Zip` pass into caller-owned output. Allocating forward paths now transform
  the mapped output in place. Compact f16 conversion remains explicit at the
  storage boundary and still executes through f32 plans.
- **Residual risk**: Dedicated post-cutoff Criterion rows remain pending from
  the prior N=16 timeout. The public six-step zero-allocation row was rerun at
  N=5120 and completed without allocation assertion failure, with 11.530 us
  mean throughput.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`; `cargo check -p apollo-fft
  --benches --examples --features kernel-strategy-bench`; `cargo test -p

### Closure XCVIII - Generic Plan Cache Scalar Routing [patch]
- **Gap**: The generic plan consolidation tried to instantiate compact
  `f16` storage as `FftPlan*<f16>`, which violated the scalar contract because
  mixed-radix arithmetic is implemented for f64/f32 complex storage and compact
  f16 routes execute through f32 at the storage boundary.
- **Closed by**: Added `RealFftData::PlanScalar` and made `PlanCacheProvider`
  return `FftPlan1D/2D/3D<Self::PlanScalar>`. f64/f32 keep native caches, f16
  delegates to the f32 cache family, and typed helpers/benches call the
  real-storage execution contracts against the resolved cached plan. The
  power-of-two fast path now starts at N>=64 after the current quick comparison
  showed N=16/N=32 remain faster on short-codelet routing.
- **Residual risk**: Public generic plan types still expose private scalar and
  workspace bounds as warnings. Fresh Criterion rows for the adjusted cutoff
  remain pending because the targeted N=16 Criterion refresh exceeded the
  300-second cap. The latest release quick comparison still misses RustFFT at
  N=32/N=64/N=128, so the next optimization should target short
  Stockham/codelet fusion and permutation removal rather than widening the
  fast-path cutoff.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`; `cargo check -p apollo-fft
  --benches --examples --features kernel-strategy-bench`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-fft --lib power_of_two -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-fft --lib typed_3d_into_supports_f64_f32_and_f16_profiles --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo run -p apollo-fft --release --features
  kernel-strategy-bench --example quick_compare` with
  `APOLLO_FFT_QUICK_N=16,32,64,128`; `python extract_benchmarks.py`;
  `python -m py_compile extract_benchmarks.py`.

### Closure XCVII - Power-of-Two Fast-Path Restoration [patch]
- **Gap**: Power-of-two sizes above the short-codelet range were not claimed
  by the selector before generic composite/PFA/Rader routing, allowing
  asymmetric lengths such as N=32768 to fall through without executing a
  transform. A forward+inverse roundtrip could hide that no-op failure mode.
- **Closed by**: Added one generic power-of-two fast-path for N>=16 before
  short Winograd, composite, PFA, or Rader routing. The path keeps N=2/N=4/N=8
  on short Winograd, uses Stockham for asymmetric powers, and retains
  square four-step only for even-exponent lengths above the four-step
  threshold. `FftPlan1D` was also moved to the generic mixed-radix twiddle and
  scratch-cache APIs instead of removed precision suffix helpers, and now
  exposes caller-owned generic typed forward/inverse methods matching the
  existing 2D/3D plan surface.
- **Residual risk**: Fresh targeted Criterion rows for
  N=16/N=32/N=64/N=128/N=32768 are pending because two pre-existing Criterion
  writers are active and still updating the cache. `benchmark_results.md` is a
  current 87-row cache snapshot rather than a dedicated post-patch run.
- **Evidence**: `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib
  mixed_precise_power_of_two_n32768_forward_dc_is_not_noop -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib
  power_of_two_asymmetric_n32768_forward_inverse_roundtrip -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib mixed_forward_n32_matches_direct

  `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples --features

  `python extract_benchmarks.py`; `python -m py_compile extract_benchmarks.py`.

### Closure XCVI - Small Good-Thomas Codelet Restoration [patch]
- **Gap**: N=6, N=10, N=12, and N=14 missed the short Winograd dispatch and
  fell through to the generic mixed-radix/PFA route, adding scratch,
  permutation, and twiddle-cache overhead to small coprime composites that are
  visible regressions in the Apollo-vs-RustFFT table.
- **Closed by**: Added stack-resident Good-Thomas CRT codelets for N=6, N=10,
  N=12, and N=14 using the existing Winograd DFT-3/4/5/7 leaves, then wired
  the monomorphized `short_winograd` dispatcher through those codelets before
  generic routing. No retained Rader, Good-Thomas, Winograd, butterfly, or
  composite route was removed. The obsolete private Good-Thomas gather helper
  left unused by the fused ordered-Rader PFA path was removed to resolve the
  bench build dead-code warning at source.
- **Residual risk**: Fresh post-patch Criterion rows for these four sizes are
  recorded in `benchmark_results.md`. N=6 f32 remains slower than RustFFT
  after this increment and is the next small-composite miss to target. A
  separate full `cargo bench -p apollo-fft` process is active and may update
  non-target Criterion rows after this snapshot.

### Closure XCV - Rader Negacyclic Twist/Recombine Fusion [patch]
- **Gap**: Rader negacyclic convolution performed separate twist and untwist
  passes over the negacyclic half around the forward/inverse convolution pair,
  even though the split and CRT recombination loops already touched the same
  elements.
- **Closed by**: Fused twist multiplication into the Nussbaumer split and
  fused conjugate untwist multiplication into CRT recombination. The cyclic
  and negacyclic forward paths still use fused radix-composite
  forward-plus-pointwise when the convolution length has supported composite
  radices. No retained Rader, Good-Thomas, Winograd, butterfly, or composite
  route was removed.
- **Residual risk**: The active full `cargo bench -p apollo-fft` run is still
  updating canonical Criterion rows during this cycle, so
  `benchmark_results.md` is a current cache snapshot rather than a complete
  dedicated post-patch benchmark run. Existing retained-route warnings remain.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`;
  `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples --features kernel-strategy-bench`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib rader -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib mixed_forward_prime -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib mixed_inverse_prime -- --test-threads=1`;
  `python extract_benchmarks.py`; `python -m py_compile extract_benchmarks.py`.

### Closure XCIV - Interleaved Two-Prime and Rader Pointwise Fusion [patch]
- **Gap**: The direct promoted-prime `2*p` route still materialized the even
  half into a stack array and compacted the odd half before entering the
  Winograd-pair two-prime kernel. Rader convolution also exposed a fused
  composite forward-plus-pointwise contract at the trait surface, but f32/f64
  scalar implementations did not implement it for test builds.
- **Closed by**: Changed the monomorphized Winograd-pair two-prime kernel to
  read interleaved `data[2*j]`/`data[2*j + 1]` input directly before writing
  natural output, removed the direct-route stack load helper, and implemented
  `composite_forward_with_pointwise` for f32/f64. This activates fused
  radix-composite forward-plus-spectrum multiplication inside Rader circular
  and negacyclic convolution for supported composite convolution lengths.
- **Residual risk**: A full workspace `cargo bench -p apollo-fft` process was
  already active and updating Criterion records during this cycle; the
  regenerated `benchmark_results.md` reflects the current Criterion cache
  snapshot, but some rows may come from that pre-existing run rather than a
  dedicated post-patch full benchmark. Existing retained-route warnings remain.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`;
  `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples --features kernel-strategy-bench`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib mixed_forward_two_by_prime -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib mixed_inverse_two_by_prime -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib two_by_prime -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib good_thomas -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib rader -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib mixed_forward_prime -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib mixed_inverse_prime -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib radix_composite -- --test-threads=1`;
  `python extract_benchmarks.py`; `python -m py_compile extract_benchmarks.py`.

### Closure XCIII - Fused Routing and Good-Thomas Permutation Tightening [patch]
- **Gap**: The fused radix-composite scalar fallback still recomputed output
  block slice bounds for each group after the stage-level radix dispatch
  refactor, and Good-Thomas PFA hot-path permutation loops still paid safe
  indexing checks despite cached permutation tables providing bounded
  `0..n` indices.
- **Closed by**: Replaced per-group radix-composite output slicing with
  `chunks_exact_mut(stage_chunk)`, changed fused final pointwise multiplication
  to raw pointer traversal over the contiguous output block, and tightened
  Good-Thomas natural/ordered-Rader gather-scatter loops with length assertions
  plus four-wide unchecked copies. The retained Winograd N=82 composite codelet
  now carries its required `PrimePairTable<41, 20>` bound. No Rader,
  Good-Thomas, Winograd, butterfly, or composite component was removed before a
  measured RustFFT-beating replacement exists.
- **Residual risk**: Fresh release Criterion numbers remain pending; this
  cycle refreshes the Markdown artifact from the existing Criterion cache and
  debug quick comparisons. Debug selected public comparison still misses
  RustFFT at N=38/N=58/N=62 and is near parity at N=106.
  `cargo fmt --check --package apollo-fft` remains blocked by broader
  worktree formatting drift outside this increment.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib radix_composite -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib good_thomas -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib mixed_radix -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples --features kernel-strategy-bench`;
  debug `quick_compare` strategy-only and selected public runs;
  `python extract_benchmarks.py`; `git diff --check`.

### Closure XCII - Radix-Composite Stage Dispatch and Benchmark Snapshot [patch]
- **Gap**: The radix-composite arity leaf exceeded the repository 500-line
  structural limit and mixed single-radix dispatch with recursive fused-stage
  scratch arena ownership. The flat fused Stockham scalar fallback also
  resolved the runtime radix match for each output group rather than once per
  stage, and the final fused pointwise multiply walked the contiguous output
  block as nested radix/column loops.
- The Rader benchmark facade referenced deleted per-prime module paths, and
  static Rader permutation arrays used unstable `N - 1` const-generic array
  expressions instead of a stable compile-time table boundary.
- **Closed by**: Moved recursive fused-composite arena ownership and adaptive
  recursion into `radix_composite/adaptive.rs`, added
  `dispatch_radix_stage::<F>` with const-radix stage bodies, routed
  `flat_stockham_fused` through the stage dispatcher, collapsed the final
  pointwise multiply into a single contiguous output pass, and retained
  Winograd large-composite leaves while restoring composite value-test
  resolution. Rader benchmark routing now calls the shared generic Rader
  implementation and the real Winograd-pair kernels; static Rader permutation
  tables are generated as dispatch-arm constants and passed into one shared
  static Rader body on stable Rust. No
  composite component is gated or removed before a measured RustFFT-beating
  replacement exists.
- **Residual risk**: Release `quick_compare` timing was not regenerated in this
  cycle. A release run with `kernel-strategy-bench` hit LLVM memory exhaustion
  while concurrent Cargo/rustc workloads were active; a later no-feature
  release check exceeded the command cap while Cargo workloads were still
  running. The regenerated `benchmark_results.md` therefore reflects the
  current Criterion cache snapshot plus a debug strategy-only quick comparison,
  not a new post-change release timing run.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`,
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib radix_composite -- --test-threads=1`,
  `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples --features kernel-strategy-bench`,
  line counts for `radix_composite/arity.rs` (421) and
  `radix_composite/adaptive.rs` (191), and `python extract_benchmarks.py`.

### Closure XCI - Rader Bluestein Cache/Vector Hook Optimization [patch]
- **Gap**: Rader Bluestein retained separate forward and inverse M-length
  kernel spectra per cached prime/precision entry. The pre/post chirp SIMD hook
  surface existed but the Bluestein runtime still used scalar loops, and the
  inverse path needed conjugated kernel multiplication without reintroducing
  the removed spectrum.
- **Closed by**: Changed Bluestein cache entries to `(chirp_fw, kernel_fw)`,
  used `conj(kernel_fw)` for inverse multiplication from the even cyclic kernel
  identity, wired pre-chirp/zero-pad and post-chirp/scaling through
  precision-specific SIMD hooks, added conjugated right-hand operand support to
  pointwise SIMD multiplication, and corrected the typed-pointer zero-fill lane
  counts in the SIMD pre-chirp path.
- **Residual risk**: The focused release `quick_compare` large-prime probe was
  blocked by active Cargo benchmark/build work in the shared environment during
  this cycle; correctness, compile, and line-limit verification remain
  authoritative for this patch. For N=10007 with M=20736, each cached entry
  saves one M-length spectrum: 331,776 bytes for f64 complex data or 165,888
  bytes for f32 complex data.
- **Evidence**: `cargo fmt --check --package apollo-fft`,
  `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`,
  `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples --features kernel-strategy-bench`,
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib rader -- --test-threads=1`,
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib mixed_forward_prime -- --test-threads=1`,
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib mixed_inverse_prime -- --test-threads=1`,
  line-count checks for `mixed_radix/scalar/simd.rs`,
  `mixed_radix/scalar/simd/pointwise.rs`, and `rader/bluestein.rs`, and
  `git diff --check` passed. The untracked Bluestein and pointwise SIMD sources
  were checked with `git diff --check --no-index`.

### Closure XC - Rader Standalone Memory-Pass Optimization [patch]
- **Gap**: Standalone generated and runtime Rader performed a separate
  `data[1..N]` pass to compute the DC nonzero sum before gathering the same
  values into primitive-root order. Rader padded scratch also retained two
  maximum-size buffers per thread and precision even though the common
  standalone/Bluestein path requires only one live Rader buffer.
- **Closed by**: Replaced the separate sum pass with fused `gather_sum_static`
  and `gather_sum_slice` helpers, applied unrolled scatter loops for static and
  runtime permutation paths, and changed Rader padded scratch to one retained
  aligned thread-local buffer per precision with local nested-call fallback.
- **Residual risk**: Release strategy-only `quick_compare` records current
  Rader absolute latencies, but the current benchmark hook aliases the Winograd
  comparison column to Rader, so fresh Rader-vs-Winograd ratios remain pending.
  Existing odd-prime-pair dead-code warnings remain outside this increment.
- **Evidence**: `cargo fmt --package apollo-fft`,
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib rader -- --test-threads=1`,
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib mixed_forward_prime -- --test-threads=1`,
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib mixed_inverse_prime -- --test-threads=1`,
  `cargo check -p apollo-fft`,
  `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples --features kernel-strategy-bench`,
  release strategy-only `quick_compare`, and `git diff --check`; the timing
  probe recorded Rader latencies of 148/126 ns at N=29, 121/123 ns at N=31,
  and 138/136 ns at N=37 for f64/f32.

### Closure LXXXIX - Fused Radix-Composite Dispatch Repair [patch]
- **Gap**: The fused radix-composite Stockham path referenced arity and tiling
  modules that were not part of a compilable module graph, and fused twiddle
  slices used stage extents that did not match each radix arm's coefficient
  contract. Radix-4 factorization verification also contradicted the active
  radix-shape policy. Strategy cleanup also lacked measured evidence comparing
  generated Rader against the Winograd-pair odd-prime alternative for
  N=29/N=31/N=37.
- **Closed by**: Reconnected `stockham_stage_fused` to `Fused2` through
  `Fused6` via the `FusedStage` ZST trait and `ExecutionPolicy` chunk
  traversal, corrected fused twiddle slice lengths to
  `(radix - 1) * prev_len * prior_product`, kept the incomplete tiling
  placeholder out of compilation, lowered only cached single-odd radix-2 tails
  to radix-4 stages, rejected highest-power radix-2 lowering because it emitted
  unsupported radix 16, added radix 4/8/17/23 dispatch coverage, added recursive
  arena scratch accounting for nested fused composition, restored direct
  N=17/N=23 Winograd routing, added direct Rader-vs-Winograd-pair equivalence
  tests, added a gated Criterion comparison group, selected Winograd-pair
  production dispatch for N=29/N=31/N=37 after bounded comparison showed
  Winograd-pair faster for all measured f64/f32 cases, consolidated generated
  Rader leaves N=17..97 into one const-generic static implementation, fused
  static Rader gather/scatter with the x0 terms, fused the Rader convolution
  pointwise spectrum multiply into the final forward composite stage, added
  static permutation-table Rader leaves for N=29/N=31/N=37 comparison to remove
  runtime modular gather/scatter index recurrence, added ordered-layout
  static/runtime Rader kernels that reuse `data[1..]` as the convolution buffer
  and omit leaf-local gather/scatter for generator-ordered fused callers,
  wired ordered Rader into Good-Thomas PFA for prime `n1` dimensions whose
  production subtransform would otherwise use Rader, added branch-selection
  coverage that preserves Winograd-pair for N=29/N=31/N=37, reused the Rader
  permutation cache in the ordered PFA branch to remove generator-order modulo
  walks from the transpose and CRT scatter loops, routed ordered-Rader PFA
  through the known-prime monomorphized ordered Rader dispatcher, added
  `APOLLO_FFT_QUICK_N` to `quick_compare`, added an
  `ordered_rader_pfa_coprime_composites` Criterion group, added a dedicated
  `good_thomas::two_by_prime` route for N=2p composites, promoted
  N=19/N=41/N=43/N=47/N=53 to odd-prime Winograd-pair dispatch, moved
  odd-prime pair kernels into `winograd/radix/odd_prime_pair.rs`, expanded
  two-by-prime benchmark coverage, replaced promoted N=2p thread-local scratch
  with const-generic stack even-half loading, removed stale composite
  fallback dispatch code, added generated-Rader direct-DFT tests for every
  generated prime leaf, added dispatch-level forward/inverse tests for
  N=29/N=31/N=37, and corrected radix-4 test assertions.
- **Residual risk**: Fresh Criterion comparison against RustFFT is pending for
  the restored fused path; the N=96 and N=192 attempts timed out before
  emitting usable timing output. Fresh Criterion comparison between Rader and
  Winograd-pair for N=29/N=31/N=37 is pending, but release strategy-only
  `quick_compare` shows Rader still behind Winograd-pair for all measured
  small-prime f64/f32 cases after static permutation-table leaves. Release
  production `quick_compare` shows N=29 and N=31 at or faster than RustFFT and
  N=37 still 11.4% slower. Ordered-layout Rader is value-verified against the
  direct DFT reference and is now used by Good-Thomas PFA for qualifying prime
  dimensions. Release promoted-prime `quick_compare` after stack compaction shows
  N=19/N=29/N=31/N=37/N=41/N=43/N=47/N=53 at
  0.907x/0.972x/0.736x/0.799x/0.720x/0.599x/0.582x/0.909x versus RustFFT.
  Release two-by-prime `quick_compare` shows
  N=38/N=58/N=62/N=74/N=82/N=86/N=94/N=106 at
  1.514x/1.195x/1.228x/1.059x/1.025x/0.943x/0.587x/0.757x; N=38 remains the
  largest residual composite gap, with N=58/N=62/N=74/N=82 marginal/noisy.
  Radix-composite and Stockham stages do not yet emit or consume the ordered
  layout.
- **Evidence**: `cargo fmt --check`,

  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib ordered -- --test-threads=1`,
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib pfa -- --test-threads=1`,
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib winograd::tests::dft_prime -- --test-threads=1`,

  `git diff --check`.

### Closure LXXXIII - Mixed-Radix Wrapper Removal [major]
- **Gap**: Public type-suffixed mixed-radix twiddle wrapper entry points
  remained after the canonical const-generic dispatch body became the single
  implementation. Dead Winograd AVX wrapper leaves also remained as exported
  internal modules.
- **Closed by**: Removed the concrete wrapper entry points, updated 1D/2D/3D
  plans and real FFT split routines to call
  `dispatch_inplace::<T, INVERSE, NORMALIZE>` directly, kept the dispatch body
  crate-private, routed radix-15 leaves through the stack-only generic
  Good-Thomas Winograd codelet, consolidated broad Stockham AVX stage/pair
  leaves behind one monomorphized backend trait, removed the dead Winograd AVX
  leaves, and deleted the unreachable CPU SIMD six-step, matrix-workspace, and
  radix2 infrastructure island that was not part of the crate module graph.
- **Residual risk**: none for this closure.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft`,
  `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples`,
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`,
  `cargo check --workspace`, stale-wrapper scan, and deleted AVX module scan.

### Closure LXXXII - Stockham Butterfly Dispatch Leaf Split [patch]
- **Gap**: `stockham/butterfly/fixed.rs` remained over the repository
  500-line structural limit and mixed generated fixed codelets with f64 AVX
  scratch dispatch routing. Benchmark targets also referenced removed
  `bluestein` and `radix2` module paths instead of the maintained generic
  selector and `real_fft` twiddle builders. `mixed_radix/dispatch_f16.rs`
  retained a type-named compact-storage routing leaf.
- **Closed by**: Extracted f64 AVX scratch routing to `butterfly::dispatch`,
  re-exported it through `butterfly::mod`, left fixed codelets in the `fixed`
  leaf, and updated benches to use the public generic selector plus current
  twiddle builders. Compact storage routing now lives in the canonical
  `mixed_radix/dispatch.rs` module through one const-generic helper.
- **Residual risk**: Release-size tooling should confirm the module split has
  no measurable codegen impact.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft`,
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`,
  `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples`, and kernel file-size scan.

### Closure LXXVI - Frequency Utility Exact-Capacity Fill [patch]
- **Gap**: `fftfreq` and `rfftfreq` built known-length output vectors through
  iterator collection, leaving avoidable iterator state and branch overhead in
  utility paths used to construct frequency grids.
- **Closed by**: Replaced the collection pipelines with exact-capacity fill
  loops while preserving numpy-compatible bin ordering and zero-length
  behavior.
- **Residual risk**: Frequency utility benchmarking should quantify the
  construction cost reduction for large grids; functional/static verification
  passed locally.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft`; `cargo check -p apollo-fft
  --benches --examples`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo check --workspace`; cleanup scans for deprecated/type-suffixed FFT
  APIs and encoding artifacts; `cargo fmt --check`; `git diff --check`.

### Closure LXXV - Shift Utility Split-Copy Cleanup [patch]
- **Gap**: `fftshift` and `ifftshift` carried an unused `Default` bound and
  duplicated modulo-index iterator collection, creating unnecessary per-element
  arithmetic and redundant generic code.
- **Closed by**: Removed the dead generic bound and routed both utilities
  through one split-slice copy helper with exact-capacity output allocation.
- **Residual risk**: The shift utility is memory-bandwidth-bound for large
  slices; benchmark evidence should quantify the copy-path gain on large real
  and complex vectors. Functional/static verification passed locally.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft`; `cargo check -p apollo-fft
  --benches --examples`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo check --workspace`; cleanup scans for deprecated/type-suffixed FFT
  APIs and encoding artifacts; `cargo fmt --check`; `git diff --check`.

### Closure LXXIV - Real/R2C Initialization Elimination [patch]
- **Gap**: Multiple hot paths for 1D, 2D, and 3D real forward/inverse transforms
  as well as 3D R2C/C2R packing still used `Array::zeros` or `.mapv` pipelines,
  which incurred unnecessary heap-initialization and traversal overhead for buffers
  that are fully overwritten before their first read.
- **Closed by**: Extended `UninitWorkspaceElement` sealed abstraction to `f64`.
  Replaced all target `Array::zeros` and `.mapv` calls with zero-allocation
  `uninit_copy_vec` + `Array::from_shape_vec` + checked overwrite (`Zip` or inplace
  kernel execution), bumped `apollo-fft` to 0.9.9, and verified workspace stability.
- **Residual risk**: Criterion benchmarking on allocation-heavy transforms (large N
  and multi-dimensional) should confirm the actual latency reduction; functional
  correctness is fully validated.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check --workspace`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft --release`
  (177/177); `git diff --check`.

### Closure LXXIII - Plan-Time Iterator Elimination [patch]
- **Gap**: Three plan construction paths in `BluesteinPlan64::new`,
  `BluesteinPlan32::new`, and `FftPlan3D::with_precision` built their chirp and
  r2c twiddle vectors through `(0..n).map(..).collect()` iterator pipelines,
  paying iterator state machine and bounds-check overhead for every element even
  though the element count is known at construction time.
- **Closed by**: Replaced all three `.map(..).collect()` chains with
  `Vec::with_capacity` + `unsafe { set_len }` + unchecked overwrite loops,
  added `#![allow(clippy::uninit_vec)]` to `dimension_3d.rs` to maintain the
  zero-warning policy, removed leftover scratch scripts from the worktree, and
  bumped `apollo-fft` to 0.9.8.
- **Residual risk**: Criterion plan-construction benchmarks on representative
  arbitrary-length sizes should confirm the reduction in construction latency.
- **Evidence**: `cargo fmt --check -p apollo-fft`; `cargo clippy -p apollo-fft
  --release -- -D warnings`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft --release` (177/177);
  `git diff --check`.

### Closure LXXII - 3D Native Real32 Exact Buffer Fill [patch]
- **Gap**: The allocating native 3D f32/f16 real path still zero-filled its
  Complex32 output before full overwrite and projected native inverse results
  through ndarray `mapv`, leaving allocation work inconsistent with the sealed
  overwrite-first workspace contract already used in 1D/2D paths.
- **Closed by**: Constrained the 3D real32 helper trait to sealed workspace
  element types, routed allocating forward output through an exact-size
  overwrite-first Complex32 buffer, and routed native inverse projection
  through an exact-size overwrite-first real buffer.
- **Residual risk**: Allocation microbenchmarks should quantify construction
  and projection cost changes for representative 3D f32/f16 volumes;
  functional/static verification passed locally.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft`; `cargo check -p apollo-fft
  --benches --examples`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo check --workspace`; cleanup scans for deprecated/type-suffixed FFT
  APIs and encoding artifacts; `cargo fmt --check`; `git diff --check`.

### Closure LXXI - 2D Native Real32 Exact Buffer Fill [patch]
- **Gap**: The native 2D f32/f16 real path still used ndarray `mapv`
  allocation pipelines for real-to-complex packing and complex-to-real
  projection, duplicating the allocation pattern already removed from 1D
  compact f16 execution.
- **Closed by**: Constrained the 2D real32 helper trait to sealed workspace
  element types and routed native packing/projection through shared exact-size
  overwrite-first buffers.
- **Residual risk**: Allocation microbenchmarks should quantify construction
  and projection cost changes for representative 2D f32/f16 matrix sizes;
  functional/static verification passed locally.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft`; `cargo check -p apollo-fft
  --benches --examples`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo check --workspace`; cleanup scans for deprecated/type-suffixed FFT
  APIs and encoding artifacts; `cargo fmt --check`; `git diff --check`.

### Closure LXX - 1D Compact F16 Exact Buffer Fill [patch]
- **Gap**: The 1D compact f16 power-of-two path still used iterator
  collection pipelines for compact input packing and output projection, while
  the rest of the FFT workspace layer had moved to explicit exact-size
  overwrite-first buffers.
- **Closed by**: Extended the sealed workspace element set to `f16` and
  `Complex<f16>`, routed compact f16 forward/inverse packing and projection
  through exact-size overwrite-first vectors, and bumped `apollo-fft` to 0.9.5.
- **Residual risk**: Allocation microbenchmarks should confirm construction
  and projection costs on representative short power-of-two f16 transforms;
  functional/static verification passed locally.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft`; `cargo check -p apollo-fft
  --benches --examples`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo check --workspace`; cleanup scans for deprecated/type-suffixed FFT
  APIs and encoding artifacts; `cargo fmt --check`; `git diff --check`.

### Closure LXIX - 1D Native Complex32 Precision Deduplication [patch]
- **Gap**: 1D f32 native execution and mixed f16 non-power-of-two execution
  duplicated `Complex32` packing, twiddle-aware kernel selection, inverse
  dispatch, and real-output projection logic.
- **Closed by**: Added private `Plan1dReal32` static-dispatch helpers,
  routed f32 native paths and mixed f16 non-power-of-two paths through one
  monomorphized forward/inverse implementation, and bumped `apollo-fft` to
  0.9.4.
- **Residual risk**: Binary-size impact should be confirmed with release-size
  tooling; functional/static verification passed locally.
- **Evidence**: `cargo fmt`; `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo check --workspace`; source cleanup scan for deprecated placeholders
  and removed wrapper names; encoding scan for mojibake/BOM markers;
  `git diff --check`.

### Closure LXVIII - Bluestein Filter Initialization Cleanup [patch]
- **Gap**: Bluestein plan construction still zero-filled the full padded
  convolution filter even though the DC and mirrored chirp regions are written
  before the filter is transformed. Generated local scripts also left a
  Stockham AVX broadcast experiment in the worktree that increased repeated
  broadcast expressions and dead commented code.
- **Closed by**: Replaced full-vector zero initialization for the Bluestein
  f64/f32 filter with overwrite-first initialization plus zero-fill of only the
  unused convolution gap, removed generated scratch scripts from the deliverable
  worktree state, preserved hoisted Stockham broadcast variables, and bumped
  `apollo-fft` to 0.9.3.
- **Residual risk**: Criterion construction-time savings need representative
  arbitrary-length FFT plan benchmarks; functional/static verification passed
  locally.
- **Evidence**: `cargo fmt --check`; `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo check --workspace`; source cleanup scan for generated scripts,
  deprecated placeholders, and removed wrapper names; encoding scan for
  mojibake/BOM markers; `git diff --check`.

### Closure LXVII - FFT Plan Scratch Allocation Consolidation [patch]
- **Gap**: Plan-owned FFT work buffers still used duplicated zero-fill or
  local uninitialized-allocation logic across 1D, 2D, 3D, R2C, and six-step
  paths.
- **Closed by**: Added one sealed `UninitWorkspaceElement` helper for the FFT
  scratch element set, routed 1D Bluestein/iRFFT scratch, 2D/3D axis-pass
  scratch, 3D R2C scratch, and six-step f32 workspaces through it, removed the
  duplicate six-step allocation helpers, and bumped `apollo-fft` to 0.9.2.
- **Residual risk**: Runtime construction-time savings need Criterion
  confirmation on representative matrix and volume sizes; functional/static
  verification passed locally.
- **Evidence**: `cargo fmt --check`; `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo check --workspace`; source cleanup scan for removed local
  helpers/deprecated placeholders; encoding scan for mojibake/BOM markers;
  `git diff --check`.

### Closure LXVI - FFT Workspace and Normalization Memory Efficiency [patch]
- **Gap**: Several FFT hot paths still paid avoidable zero-fill or repeated
  scalar normalization overhead in buffers that are fully overwritten before
  read.
- **Closed by**: Added shared f64/f32 normalization helpers with AVX runtime
  dispatch, routed Stockham/Bluestein/mixed-radix inverse scale passes through
  them, filled twiddle and composite twiddle vectors through exact pre-sized
  cursors with debug invariants, skipped zero-fill for overwritten composite
  scratch and six-step workspace buffers, and bumped `apollo-fft` to 0.9.1.
- **Residual risk**: Runtime performance ratios need Criterion confirmation on
  representative hardware; functional and static verification passed locally.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check --workspace`; stale-token scans for removed wrappers/deprecated/debug references; encoding scan for mojibake/BOM markers; `git diff --check`.

### Closure LXV - FFT Auto-Selector Wrapper Removal [major]
- **Gap**: `apollo-fft` still exposed concrete f64/f32 public auto-selector
  wrappers even though `fft_forward`, `fft_inverse`, and `fft_inverse_unnorm`
  are the canonical generic API.
- **Closed by**: Deleted `fft_forward_64`, `fft_inverse_64`,
  `fft_inverse_unnorm_64`, `fft_forward_32`, `fft_inverse_32`, and
  `fft_inverse_unnorm_32`; routed `FftPrecision` implementations directly to
  mixed-radix dispatch; updated plan fallbacks, tests, and benchmarks to use the
  generic API; and bumped `apollo-fft` to 0.9.0.
- **Residual risk**: External pre-1.0 callers using the removed concrete
  wrappers must migrate to the generic FFT API.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check --workspace`; `cargo check -p apollo-fft-wgpu --tests`; source scans for removed auto-selector wrapper names, direct DFT wrapper names, Winograd wrapper names, debug binary references, stale compatibility/deprecation tokens, and deleted f16 wrapper names; `git diff --check`.

### Closure LXIV - FFT Recursive Winograd Generic Codelets [major]
- **Gap**: `apollo-fft` still exposed public type-suffixed Winograd DFT-16/32/64
  wrappers and carried duplicated f32/f64 recursive codelet bodies.
- **Closed by**: Replaced DFT-16/32/64 f32/f64 bodies with generic
  `dft16_impl`, `dft32_impl`, and `dft64_impl`, routed mixed-radix dispatch to
  those generic implementations, renamed the stale type-suffixed twiddle table,
  and bumped `apollo-fft` to 0.8.0.
- **Residual risk**: External pre-1.0 callers using the removed DFT-16/32/64
  wrappers must migrate to the public auto-selecting FFT API.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check --workspace`; source scans for removed DFT-16/32/64 wrapper names, short-Winograd wrapper names, direct DFT wrapper names, debug binary references, stale compatibility/deprecation tokens, and deleted f16 wrapper names; `git diff --check`.

### Closure LXIII - FFT Short-Winograd Wrapper Removal [major]
- **Gap**: `apollo-fft` still exposed type-suffixed short-Winograd public
  wrappers for small codelets and twiddle multiplication even though generic
  implementations already existed.
- **Closed by**: Deleted the public DFT-2/3/4/5/7/8 f64/f32 wrapper functions
  and `apply_twiddle_64` / `apply_twiddle_32`, routed mixed-radix short
  dispatch through the generic Winograd implementation functions, removed stale
  wrapper documentation, and bumped `apollo-fft` to 0.7.0.
- **Residual risk**: External pre-1.0 callers using the removed short-Winograd
  wrappers must migrate to the generic internalized path or the public
  auto-selecting FFT API.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check --workspace`; source scans for removed short-Winograd wrapper names, direct DFT wrapper names, debug binary references, stale compatibility/deprecation tokens, and deleted f16 wrapper names; `git diff --check`.

### Closure LXII - FFT Direct DFT Wrapper Removal [major]
- **Gap**: The direct DFT reference kernel still exposed type-suffixed
  wrapper functions and an unused debug-only f32 parity binary, duplicating the
  canonical generic DFT API surface.
- **Closed by**: Deleted `dft_forward_64`, `dft_inverse_64`,
  `dft_forward_32`, `dft_inverse_32`, `forward_owned_64`, `inverse_owned_64`,
  removed `src/bin/debug_f32.rs`, updated direct DFT tests, benchmarks, and
  kernel regressions to use `dft_forward` / `dft_inverse`, and bumped
  `apollo-fft` to 0.6.0.
- **Residual risk**: External pre-1.0 callers using the removed direct DFT
  wrappers must migrate to the generic functions.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples`; `cargo
  test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check --workspace`;
  source scans for removed direct DFT wrapper names, debug binary references,
  stale compatibility/deprecation tokens, and deleted f16 wrapper names; `git
  diff --check`.

### Closure LXI - FFT Composite Scratch and Twiddle Cache Reuse [patch]
- **Gap**: Bluestein and mixed-radix composite FFT paths still retained
  allocation-heavy scratch behavior and stale docs. The composite twiddle cache
  also keyed by transform length only, which could alias different public
  radix decompositions with the same product.
- **Closed by**: Reused one thread-local Bluestein scratch buffer per
  precision, reused one thread-local composite scratch buffer per precision,
  cached composite twiddle tables by exact radix decomposition and direction,
  added same-length/different-radix-order regression coverage, removed stale
  allocation and `MaybeUninit` docs, and bumped `apollo-fft` to 0.5.3.
- **Residual risk**: Larger FFT kernel implementation files remain above the
  structural limit and require follow-up module partitioning.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples`; `cargo
  test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check --workspace`;
  source scans for stale `MaybeUninit`/per-call allocation docs, stale
  compatibility/deprecation tokens, and deleted f16 wrapper names; `git diff
  --check`.

### Closure LX - FFT 3D Typed Plan Deduplication [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-fft` duplicated 3D f32 and f16 typed forward/inverse logic
  across allocating and caller-owned APIs, leaving four precision-specific
  bodies plus a now-redundant f32-only real-to-complex writer.
- **Closed by**: Added private `Plan3dReal32` static-dispatch storage
  abstraction, routed `forward_f32`, `inverse_f32`, `forward_f32_into`,
  `inverse_f32_into`, `forward_f16`, `inverse_f16`, `forward_f16_into`, and
  `inverse_f16_into` through shared monomorphized helpers, deleted the dead
  f32-only writer, and bumped `apollo-fft` to 0.5.2.
- **Residual risk**: Larger FFT kernel implementation files remain above the
  structural limit and require follow-up module partitioning.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples`; `cargo
  test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check --workspace`;
  source scans for removed f32-only 3D writer, stale
  compatibility/deprecation tokens, and deleted f16 wrapper names; `git diff
  --check`.

### Closure LIX - FFT 2D Typed Plan Deduplication [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-fft` duplicated the 2D f32 and f16 typed forward/inverse
  bodies, duplicated the 2D plan module-level Rustdoc block, and kept
  crate-root tests inside `lib.rs`, leaving the crate root above the 500-line
  structural limit.
- **Closed by**: Added private `Plan2dReal32` static-dispatch storage
  abstraction, routed `forward_f32`, `inverse_f32`, `forward_f16`, and
  `inverse_f16` through shared monomorphized helpers, removed duplicated 2D
  Rustdoc, moved crate-root tests into `lib_tests.rs`, and bumped
  `apollo-fft` to 0.5.1.
- **Residual risk**: Larger FFT kernel implementation files remain above the
  structural limit and require follow-up module partitioning.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples`; `cargo
  test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check --workspace`;
  structural scan confirming `lib.rs` is 434 lines; source scan for stale
  compatibility/deprecation tokens and deleted f16 wrapper names; `git diff
  --check`.

### Closure LVIII - FFT Compatibility Alias Removal [major]
- **Gap**: `apollo-fft` retained the stale `FftPlan3D::nz_complex` alias,
  `HalfSpectrum3D::nz_complex` field, and compatibility wording after the FFT
  API surface had been consolidated around canonical owner modules and generic
  precision dispatch.
- **Closed by**: Deleted `FftPlan3D::nz_complex`, renamed
  `HalfSpectrum3D::nz_complex` to `HalfSpectrum3D::nz_c`, kept `nz_c` as the
  single half-spectrum bookkeeping name, removed stale compatibility wording
  from FFT kernel/backend docs, and bumped `apollo-fft` to 0.5.0.
- **Residual risk**: External pre-1.0 callers using `nz_complex` must migrate to
  `nz_c`.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples`; `cargo
  test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check --workspace`;
  source scans for removed `nz_complex`, f16-specific wrapper names, and stale
  compatibility/deprecation tokens; `git diff --check`.

### Closure LVII - Radix F16 Module Removal [major]
- **Gap**: `apollo-fft` still exposed compact f16 complex storage through a
  radix-specific `radix2_f16` module and custom `Cf16` wrapper. The f16 bridge
  was type-specific, and a dead native f16 CPU gate remained in the kernel
  directory.
- **Closed by**: Deleted the radix-specific f16 module, deleted dead f16-named
  bridge/gate files, replaced `Cf16` with `num_complex::Complex<half::f16>`,
  added `precision_bridge::Complex32Bridge` as the generic monomorphized
  compact-storage bridge with reusable Complex32 scratch, updated FFT kernel
  exports, removed public f16-specific FFT wrappers in favor of generic
  `fft_forward`/`fft_inverse` dispatch, updated twiddle-table output, 1D
  precision paths, benchmarks, and SIMD imports, and bumped `apollo-fft` to
  0.4.0.
- **Residual risk**: The public `Cf16` type is removed. In-repo callers are
  updated; external pre-1.0 callers must migrate to `Complex<half::f16>`.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples`; `cargo
  test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check --workspace`;
  source scans for removed `Cf16`, `radix2_f16`, public f16-specific wrappers,
  f16-named kernel files, and f16 bridge names; `git diff --check`.

### Closure LVI - FFT Remote Integration and Short-Winograd Dispatch [patch]
- **Gap**: Remote RustFFT comparator work targeted the older radix-specific
  kernel topology and conflicted with the current Stockham/composite/Bluestein
  architecture. The local mixed-radix facade also retained unused f16 twiddle
  caches even though f16 storage execution promotes to f32.
- **Closed by**: Kept deleted radix kernel modules removed, retained RustFFT
  comparator coverage through the live `vs_rustfft` benchmark, switched
  `apollo-fft` to the workspace `rustfft` dev-dependency, removed dead
  radix-specific `kernel_strategy` rows, added shared `ShortWinogradScalar`
  static dispatch for exact 2/4/8/16/32/64 f64/f32 transforms before
  Stockham/composite/Bluestein routing, and removed unused f16 twiddle caches.
- **Residual risk**: Criterion throughput numbers after the merge need a
  dedicated benchmark run on representative hardware; correctness and compile
  checks cover the code path.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check
  --workspace`; `cargo test -p apollo-hilbert --lib -- --test-threads=1`;
  conflict-marker scan; dead f16-cache/dead benchmark scan; `git diff
  --check`.

### Closure LV - Apollo-Hilbert Caller-Owned Observable Projections [minor]
- **Gap**: `AnalyticSignal` projection methods allocated new vectors and
  duplicated projection formulas directly in each allocating method. Plan-level
  `envelope` and `phase` also forced an owned analytic signal allocation even
  when callers could provide output storage.
- **Closed by**: Added caller-owned `AnalyticSignal::*_into` projection
  methods, routed allocating projections through shared non-generic slice
  helpers, added `HilbertPlan::envelope_into` and `phase_into`, routed
  allocating plan observables through a reused per-thread Complex64 analytic
  scratch buffer, added parity/mismatch/capacity tests, updated the Hilbert
  README, and bumped `apollo-hilbert` to 0.3.0.
- **Residual risk**: Owned projection APIs still allocate their return vectors
  by contract. Callers that need allocation control should use the new
  caller-owned projection methods.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-hilbert`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert observables --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert envelope --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-validation`; `rg` source scans for removed projection duplication
  patterns.

### Closure LIV - Apollo-Hilbert Caller-Owned Analytic Signal [minor]
- **Gap**: `hilbert_transform_into` still allocated an owned analytic
  `Vec<Complex64>` on every caller-owned quadrature call, and callers had no
  public plan-level way to provide analytic output storage directly. The crate
  root documentation also still described private DFT ownership after Hilbert
  moved to Apollo FFT plan execution.
- **Closed by**: Added direct `analytic_signal_into`, added
  `HilbertPlan::analytic_signal_into`, routed owned analytic execution through
  the caller-owned kernel, routed caller-owned quadrature through a reused
  thread-local Complex64 analytic scratch buffer, added parity/mismatch/scratch
  capacity tests, updated README and crate-root docs, and bumped
  `apollo-hilbert` to 0.2.0.
- **Residual risk**: The owned `analytic_signal` API still allocates its
  returned `Vec<Complex64>` by contract. Caller-owned analytic and quadrature
  paths now avoid additional analytic bridge allocation.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-hilbert`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert analytic --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert workspace --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-validation`; `rg` source scans for removed caller-owned quadrature
  analytic allocation patterns.

### Closure LIII - Apollo FFT Slice Real Forward for Hilbert [minor]
- **Gap**: `apollo-hilbert` still built an `Array1<f64>` from every real input
  slice because `apollo-fft` exposed the optimized 1D real-forward owner path
  only through ndarray input. The existing ndarray caller-owned path also
  duplicated the real-forward implementation body instead of delegating to a
  slice-level owner routine.
- **Closed by**: Added
  `FftPlan1D::forward_real_to_complex_slice_into`, routed the existing ndarray
  caller-owned path through it, routed Hilbert analytic-signal execution through
  the cached FFT plan's slice path, removed the dead `ndarray` dependency from
  `apollo-hilbert`, split 1D precision methods and tests into leaf modules so
  `dimension_1d.rs` stays below 500 lines, added slice parity/rejection
  coverage, updated READMEs, bumped `apollo-fft` to 0.3.0, and bumped
  `apollo-hilbert` to 0.1.4.
- **Residual risk**: Hilbert still allocates its analytic `Vec<Complex64>`
  output per owning API call because the public `analytic_signal` contract
  returns owned storage. The caller-owned quadrature and typed bridge paths now
  avoid all additional input bridge arrays.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft
  caller_owned_paths --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft
  forward_slice --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib
  -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p apollo-hilbert`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-validation`; `rg` source scans for removed Hilbert ndarray
  bridge/dependency patterns.

### Closure LII - Apollo-Hilbert Analytic In-Place Spectrum Reuse [patch]
- **Gap**: `analytic_signal` copied the forward FFT output into a `Vec`,
  rebuilt an `Array1` from that vector, allocated a separate inverse FFT output
  array, and copied the inverse result back into another `Vec`. Owned
  quadrature also called the allocating analytic-signal path before projecting
  the imaginary component.
- **Closed by**: Kept the forward FFT output array as the analytic spectrum,
  applied the Hilbert mask in place, ran the complex inverse in place, moved the
  contiguous buffer out once for `analytic_signal`, routed `hilbert_transform`
  through `hilbert_transform_into`, updated the Hilbert README, and bumped
  `apollo-hilbert` to 0.1.3.
- **Residual risk**: The real input bridge `Array1<f64>` remains because
  `apollo_fft::fft_1d_array` is the current optimized real-forward API. Removing
  that allocation requires a slice-level real FFT entry point in `apollo-fft`.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-hilbert`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert transform --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-validation`; `rg` source scans for removed analytic-signal copy
  allocation patterns.

### Closure LI - Apollo-Hilbert Owner Quadrature Slice Kernel [patch]
- **Gap**: `HilbertPlan::transform_into` called the allocating
  `hilbert_transform` owner function and copied the returned quadrature vector
  into caller-owned output. `apollo-hilbert` also retained a direct `rayon`
  dependency after the private parallel O(N²) DFT kernels were removed.
- **Closed by**: Added `hilbert_transform_into` as the slice-level owner
  quadrature kernel, routed `HilbertPlan::transform_into` through it, kept typed
  execution on the same shared owner path, removed the unused direct `rayon`
  dependency, added direct kernel parity/mismatch tests, updated the Hilbert
  README, and bumped `apollo-hilbert` to 0.1.2.
- **Residual risk**: The analytic-signal owner kernel still allocates FFT input,
  spectrum, and analytic buffers because the current `apollo_fft` public array
  entry points own those conversions. That is the next bounded Hilbert memory
  target.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-hilbert`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert transform_into --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-validation`; `rg` source scans for removed copy-through allocation and
  dead direct dependency.

### Closure L - Apollo-Hilbert Typed Workspace Reuse [patch]
- **Gap**: `HilbertPlan::analytic_signal_typed` and
  `transform_typed_into` allocated f64 bridge vectors on every reduced-storage
  call before entering the shared owner Hilbert implementation.
- **Closed by**: Added thread-local f64 input and output workspaces for typed
  Hilbert execution, preserved the `f64` zero-copy specialization, routed
  reduced-storage execution through the existing analytic-mask owner path, added
  repeated-call f32 capacity/value coverage, updated the Hilbert README, and
  bumped `apollo-hilbert` to 0.1.1.
- **Residual risk**: Typed Hilbert scratch is retained per thread at the
  largest signal length executed by that thread. Recursive same-thread typed
  Hilbert calls are rejected by `RefCell` borrow checking.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-hilbert`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert workspace --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-hilbert --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-validation`; `rg` source scan for removed Hilbert production typed
  bridge allocation patterns.

### Closure XLIX - Apollo-SDFT Typed Workspace Reuse [patch]
- **Gap**: `SdftPlan::direct_bins_typed_into` allocated an f64 input bridge
  vector and Complex64 output bridge vector on every typed direct-bin call
  before entering the owner direct-bin kernel.
- **Closed by**: Added thread-local f64/Complex64 direct-bin workspaces,
  routed typed direct-bin execution through the shared owner kernel without
  per-call bridge allocation, added repeated-call f32 capacity/value coverage,
  updated the SDFT README, and bumped `apollo-sdft` to 0.1.1.
- **Residual risk**: Typed direct-bin scratch is retained per thread at the
  largest window length and bin count executed by that thread. Recursive
  same-thread typed direct-bin calls are rejected by `RefCell` borrow checking.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-sdft`; `cargo test -p apollo-sdft
  workspace --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-sdft --lib --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p apollo-validation`; `rg` source scan for
  removed SDFT production typed bridge allocation patterns.

### Closure XLVIII - Apollo-STFT Inverse WOLA Workspace Reuse [patch]
- **Gap**: The STFT inverse owner path allocated four work buffers per call:
  frame-domain samples, complex frame FFT input, overlap accumulation, and
  squared-window weight accumulation. The typed inverse path inherited the same
  allocations through the shared owner inverse kernel.
- **Closed by**: Added thread-local WOLA workspaces for frame, complex,
  overlap, and weight buffers; routed `inverse_into`, `inverse`, and typed
  inverse through the same slice-level owner path; zeroed only accumulation
  buffers before WOLA; added repeated-call value/capacity reuse coverage;
  updated the STFT ADR and README; and bumped `apollo-stft` to 0.2.1.
- **Residual risk**: Inverse WOLA scratch is retained per thread at the largest
  frame work length and signal length executed by that thread. Recursive
  same-thread inverse calls are rejected by `RefCell` borrow checking.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-stft`; `cargo test -p apollo-stft
  workspace --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-stft --lib --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p apollo-validation`; `rg` source scan for
  removed STFT production inverse WOLA allocation patterns.

### Closure XLVII - Apollo-STFT Typed Workspace Reuse and Alias Removal [major]
- **Gap**: `StftPlan::forward_typed_into` and `inverse_typed_into` allocated
  owner-precision `Array1` bridge buffers per call before entering the f64 /
  Complex64 owner path. `forward_inplace` and `inverse_inplace` were
  deprecated allocating aliases, and `dimension_1d.rs` exceeded the structural
  file-size limit.
- **Closed by**: Added slice-level f64/Complex64 execution entry points,
  reused thread-local typed bridge workspaces, moved storage/profile traits to
  `stft::storage`, moved tests into a leaf module, added a co-located ADR,
  removed the deprecated alias methods and README references, added
  repeated-call f32 workspace reuse coverage, and bumped `apollo-stft` to 0.2.0.
- **Residual risk**: Typed scratch is retained per thread at the largest STFT
  signal and spectrum dimensions executed by that thread. The inverse owner
  WOLA allocation gap was closed in Closure XLVIII.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-stft`; `cargo test -p apollo-stft
  workspace --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-stft --lib --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p apollo-validation`; `rg` source scan for
  removed STFT production typed bridge allocation and deprecated alias
  patterns.

### Closure XLVI - Apollo-QFT Dense and Typed Workspace Reuse [patch]
- **Gap**: `QftPlan::forward_into` and `inverse_into` allocated a dense
  transform vector before copying into caller-owned output, and typed QFT paths
  allocated Complex64 input/output bridge arrays per call.
- **Closed by**: Added dense `*_into` kernels, routed plan execution through
  Complex64 slices, reused thread-local Complex64 typed bridge workspaces,
  added repeated-call complex32 forward/inverse workspace reuse coverage, and
  bumped `apollo-qft` to 0.1.1.
- **Residual risk**: Typed scratch is retained per thread at the largest QFT
  dimension executed by that thread. The intentionally allocating convenience
  dense wrappers remain for callers that request owned `Vec` output.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-qft`; `cargo test -p apollo-qft
  workspace --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-qft --lib --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p apollo-validation`; `rg` scan for removed
  QFT production plan/typed allocation patterns.

### Closure XLV - Apollo-GFT Typed Workspace Reuse [patch]
- **Gap**: GFT typed storage paths allocated f64 input/output bridge arrays
  per forward and inverse call before invoking the owner graph-basis multiply.
- **Closed by**: Added contiguous f64 slice execution on `GftPlan`, reused
  thread-local f64 input/output workspaces for typed storage, added
  repeated-call f32 forward/inverse workspace reuse coverage, and bumped
  `apollo-gft` to 0.1.1.
- **Residual risk**: Typed scratch is retained per thread at the largest graph
  order executed by that thread. This replaces repeated allocation with
  bounded reuse.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-gft`; `cargo test -p apollo-gft
  workspace --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-gft --lib --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p apollo-validation`; `rg` scan for removed
  GFT production typed bridge allocation patterns.

### Closure XLIV - Apollo-FWHT Typed Workspace Reuse [patch]
- **Gap**: FWHT typed storage defaults allocated f64 input/output bridge
  arrays per call, and mixed f16 FWHT allocated a fresh f32 compute vector per
  forward/inverse call.
- **Closed by**: Added contiguous f64 slice execution on `FwhtPlan`, reused
  thread-local f64 bridge workspaces for default typed storage, reused a
  thread-local f32 compute workspace for mixed f16 storage, added repeated-call
  workspace reuse coverage, and bumped `apollo-fwht` to 0.1.1.
- **Residual risk**: Typed scratch is retained per thread at the largest FWHT
  length executed by that thread. This replaces repeated allocation with
  bounded reuse.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fwht`; `cargo test -p apollo-fwht
  workspace --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-fwht --lib --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p apollo-validation`; `rg` scan for removed
  FWHT production typed bridge allocation patterns.

### Closure XLIII - Apollo-CZT Workspace Reuse and FFT Warning Cleanup [patch]
- **Gap**: `CztPlan` allocated a fresh Complex64 Bluestein convolution
  workspace on every plan-path forward call, typed CZT paths allocated
  Complex64 bridge arrays for forward/inverse, inverse CZT rebuilt
  Vandermonde nodes per call, and `apollo-fft` still retained unused radix-2
  butterfly helpers after Stockham became canonical.
- **Closed by**: Added plan-owned convolution scratch, added CZT slice
  execution, precomputed square-plan inverse nodes, reused thread-local typed
  bridge workspaces, removed dead radix-2 helper code, added missing
  `FftPlan3D` Rustdoc, and bumped `apollo-czt` to 0.2.1 plus `apollo-fft` to
  0.2.2.
- **Residual risk**: CZT forward scratch is retained per plan at
  `convolution_len`; typed bridge scratch is retained per thread at the
  largest typed CZT input/output dimensions used on that thread. This replaces
  repeated allocation with bounded reuse.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-czt`; `cargo test -p apollo-czt workspace --lib -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-czt --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-fft radix2 --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-czt-wgpu -p apollo-validation`; `rg` scans for deleted CZT typed
  bridge allocation patterns and removed radix-2 helper names.

### Closure XLII - Apollo-FFT Dead Helper Cleanup [patch]
- **Gap**: Current `apollo-fft` kernel sources retained unused helper
  implementations after the power-of-two path moved to Stockham/composite
  routing: f16 with-twiddles bridge allocation, uniform power-of-two
  digit-reversal helpers, power-of-four/eight shape predicates, and unused
  Winograd stage traits.
- **Closed by**: Removed the dead helpers and their stale tests/docs while
  retaining the live bit-reversal primitive for radix-2 and mixed-radix
  permutation for composite FFT routing.
- **Residual risk**: None identified for the removed items; the final source
  scan reports no references to the deleted helper names.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft
  radix_shape --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft
  radix_permute --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `rg` scan for the deleted helper
  names.

### Closure XLII - Apollo-FRFT Typed Workspace Reuse [patch]
- **Gap**: `FrftStorage` typed paths for `Complex32` and `[f16; 2]` allocated
  one Complex64 input array and one Complex64 output array per call before
  invoking the direct FrFT implementation.
- **Closed by**: Added internal Complex64 slice entry points on `FrftPlan`,
  replaced typed bridge arrays with thread-local reusable input/output
  workspaces, added a repeated-call workspace reuse regression test, restored
  the current `apollo-fft` module/import drift that blocked dependency
  compilation, and bumped `apollo-frft` to 0.1.2 plus `apollo-fft` to 0.2.1.
- **Residual risk**: Typed scratch is retained per thread at the largest typed
  FrFT length executed on that thread. This is the same bounded reuse tradeoff
  as the unitary workspace cleanup.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-frft`; `cargo test -p apollo-frft typed
  --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-frft --lib --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p apollo-frft-wgpu -p apollo-validation`;
  `rg` scan for removed typed bridge `Array1::from_iter` / `output64`
  allocation patterns.

### Closure XLII - Apollo-FRFT Unitary Workspace Reuse [patch]
- **Gap**: `UnitaryFrftPlan` allocated a fresh O(N) coefficient vector on every
  forward and inverse execution even though the Candan-Grünbaum algorithm only
  requires one temporary coefficient workspace per executing thread.
- **Closed by**: Added thread-local reusable coefficient scratch for the
  projection, phase, and reconstruction steps, added a regression test for
  capacity reuse and output equality, removed stale backward-compatibility
  wording from live crate-root exports, and bumped `apollo-frft` to 0.1.1.
- **Residual risk**: Scratch is retained per thread at the largest unitary FrFT
  length executed on that thread. This trades repeated heap allocation for
  bounded thread-local reuse.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-frft`; `cargo test -p apollo-frft
  unitary --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo test -p apollo-frft --lib --
  --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p apollo-frft-wgpu -p apollo-validation`;
  `rg` scan for stale FrFT compatibility/deprecated markers and the removed
  `vec![Complex64::new(0.0, 0.0); n]` allocation.

### Closure XLII - Apollo-FFT Compatibility Re-Export Cleanup [major]
- **Gap**: `apollo-fft` retained compatibility re-export modules and a legacy
  `FFT_CACHE` alias after root exports already exposed the canonical public
  names. It also retained unused power-of-four/eight forwarding modules under
  `infrastructure::cpu::simd::power_of_two` that duplicated radix-2 execution.
- **Closed by**: Removed the compatibility modules, removed `FFT_CACHE`, deleted
  the unused forwarding modules, updated in-repo callers to root or canonical
  paths, fixed a test-only `Complex32/64` import gap surfaced by the full test
  build, and bumped `apollo-fft` to 0.2.0.
- **Residual risk**: External callers using the removed compatibility paths must
  migrate to root exports or canonical owner modules. This is an intentional
  pre-1.0 breaking cleanup.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-fft-wgpu -p apollo-czt -p apollo-nufft -p apollo-stft -p apollo-sft`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`; `cargo check -p
  apollo-fft --benches`; `rg` scan for removed compatibility paths and legacy
  aliases in touched crate sources.

### Closure XLII - STFT-WGPU Deprecated Error and Retained-Resource Cleanup [major]
- **Gap**: `apollo-stft-wgpu` retained a deprecated
  `WgpuError::FrameLenNotPowerOfTwo` public variant after Chirp-Z support made
  non-power-of-two frame lengths valid, and retained GPU resources used explicit
  dead-code suppressions.
- **Closed by**: Removed the stale error variant, strengthened non-power-of-two
  tests to require successful Chirp-Z execution/buffer construction, renamed
  retained GPU resource fields with `_` ownership names, and bumped
  `apollo-stft-wgpu` to 0.11.0. Removed the remaining NUFFT/NTT WGPU
  dead-code suppressions by enforcing NUFFT reusable-buffer sample capacity
  before GPU writes, replacing NUFFT per-dispatch layout-placeholder allocations
  with one retained layout padding buffer, deleting duplicated NTT scalar
  `n_inv` storage, and keeping retained NTT GPU resources as explicit `_` owner
  fields.
- **Residual risk**: GPU-gated execution remains dependent on adapter
  availability; tests skip only when no WGPU device can be acquired.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-stft-wgpu`; `cargo test -p
  apollo-stft-wgpu --lib -- --test-threads=1`; matching `cargo check` and
  `cargo test --lib` for `apollo-nufft-wgpu` and `apollo-ntt-wgpu`; `rg` scans
  for `FrameLenNotPowerOfTwo`, `#[allow(dead_code)]`, deprecated markers, and
  NUFFT placeholder buffers in the audited WGPU crate sources.

### Closure XLII - DCT/DST Fast-Path Unused Output Allocation Cleanup [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-dctdst` single-output DCT-II and DST-II fast paths allocated
  an N-length sibling output only to call the dual DCT/DST projection kernel.
- **Closed by**: Factored the shared 2N-point FFT setup and projection-fill
  helpers so `dct2_fast` fills only DCT-II and `dst2_fast` fills only DST-II,
  while `dct2_dst2_fast` still computes both projections from one FFT.
- **Residual risk**: The fast path still allocates the required 2N complex FFT
  buffer and FFT output; this increment removes only the provably unused
  real-output allocation.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-dctdst`; focused fast-path regression
  test comparing single-projection outputs to the dual kernel and direct
  analytical DCT-II/DST-II kernels; full `cargo test -p apollo-dctdst --lib
  -- --test-threads=1`.

### Closure XLII — Apollo vs RustFFT f32 N=4096 Performance Disparity [patch]
- **Gap**: Apollo f32 N=4096 throughput remains behind RustFFT; prior evidence
  depended on a plan-scratch benchmark route that is absent from the current
  checkout API surface.
- **Closed by**: Rejected the candidate that disabled the f32 N=4096 radix-16
  quad suffix after same-session Criterion measured Apollo 6.5098 µs vs RustFFT
  3.7433 µs. Restored the local `vs_rustfft` benchmark to compile against the
  present API with a local RustFFT dev-dependency and current mixed-radix
  precomputed-twiddle calls.
- **Residual risk**: Current f32 N=4096 precomputed-twiddle row measures Apollo
  22.790 µs vs RustFFT 3.5969 µs. This indicates API/dispatch drift, not a
  retained Stockham codelet improvement, and is not comparable to the prior
  plan-scratch row.
- **Evidence**: `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches`; `cargo test -p apollo-fft
  dft7 --lib -- --test-threads=1`; focused Criterion f32 N=4096 Apollo/RustFFT
  precomputed-twiddle and quad-disabled probes.
- **Follow-up increment**: Large f32 power-of-two dispatch now uses the
  monomorphized Stockham scratch-backed kernel with thread-local scratch,
  eliminating the prior radix-8 facade route. Final retained f32 N=4096
  Criterion measured Apollo zero-alloc reused 7.0463 µs, Apollo caller-twiddle
  reused 8.9737 µs, and RustFFT reused 6.2814 µs. The initial production 8x512
  hybrid and direct no-argument micro-dispatch probes were rejected because
  they regressed the then-retained route.
- **Current residual**: The f32 N=4096 retained schedule now disables the
  spilling quad suffix while preserving stride-64 triple suppression, then uses
  a single-entry thread-local f32 forward-twiddle fast cache for the public path.
  Longer Criterion measured Apollo zero-alloc reused 6.3347 µs, Apollo
  caller-twiddle reused 6.0315 µs, and RustFFT reused 4.2974 µs. The remaining
  gap is in the Stockham f32 N=4096 memory traffic/kernel body, not hot-path
  allocation or `Arc` cloning.
- **Correctness correction**: The terminal groups=1 in-place Stockham hook was
  removed after audit because the source layout is interleaved
  (`src[2j]`, `src[2j+1]`) and a direct in-place final stage overwrites future
  inputs. Static N=4096 f32 twiddle specialization, direct concrete benchmark
  calls, shortened public branching, zero-copy generic schedule flipping, and
  split public scratch/twiddle caching were all rejected by focused Criterion
  probes.
- **Current retained result**: The verified f32 8x512 helper remains test-only
  after same-tree Criterion showed the generic Stockham route was faster. The
  retained f32 N=4096 path uses the radix-8/radix-8 tail schedule and split
  public scratch/twiddle caches; the dead combined workspace was removed.
  Final current-tree Criterion measured Apollo public zero-alloc reused
  5.4298 µs, Apollo caller-twiddle reused 5.2661 µs, and RustFFT reused
  3.6958 µs. Earlier same-state retained measurement reached Apollo public
  4.8645 µs and caller-twiddle 4.7913 µs. The residual gap remains in f32
  Stockham stage memory traffic and kernel shape. Rejected follow-up probes:
  64 KiB low-live threshold, separate single-entry Stockham twiddle cache,
  direct N=4096 four-pass specialization, unchecked twiddle subslices,
  stride-64 radix-16 fusion, and forced Stockham AVX/cache inlining. The latest
  retained run after reverts measured Apollo public zero-alloc reused
  5.4895 µs, Apollo caller-twiddle reused 5.4176 µs, and RustFFT reused
  4.3328 µs. Subsequent rejected hot-codelet probes were paired 128-bit stores
  in the quarter-groups-one suffix, even-radix tail monomorphization for that
  suffix, and const-generic radix-1 quarter-turn signs. Each preserved
  correctness but failed the focused Criterion retention gate.
- **Assembly finding**: `cargo rustc -p apollo-fft --release --lib -- --emit=asm`
  showed the separate f32 Stockham codelets pay Windows ABI vector-register
  prologue cost. A private raw-pointer `sysv64` ABI removed the XMM6-XMM15
  save block from the quarter-groups-one suffix assembly, but focused Criterion
  did not retain an Apollo caller-twiddle improvement, so the ABI probe was
  reverted. The next viable path is reducing the codelet's live vector state or
  fusing the N=4096 call boundary without an unsupported `#[inline(always)]`
  target-feature combination.
- **Nonsimd/SWAR audit**: GhostCell is not applicable to the retained f32
  N=4096 hot route because there is no graph-like shared mutable topology;
  scratch storage is thread-local and borrowed lexically. A scalar
  power-of-two digit-reversal cleanup replaced division/modulo with shift/mask
  digit extraction for non-Stockham routes. Focused f32 N=256 Criterion was
  neutral for Apollo, so the measured small-size gap is in radix-4
  butterfly/scheduling work, not the digit-reversal arithmetic.
- **Autosort expansion**: The f32 forward Stockham threshold was lowered from
  1024 to 256, moving N=256 off the radix-4 digit-reversal route and onto
  caller-scratch Stockham. Focused Criterion repeat measured Apollo public
  197.50 ns and caller-twiddle 218.36 ns versus the prior digit-reversal route
  near 983.67 ns and 991.61 ns. N=64 autosort was rejected because public
  dispatch regressed while caller-twiddle was neutral.
- **Inverse autosort integration**: f32 power-of-two inverse paths now use
  Stockham with inverse twiddles for lengths >=256. Normalized inverse reuses
  the unnormalized Stockham route and applies explicit `1/N` scaling. New
  inverse rows in `vs_rustfft` showed the old digit-reversal baseline at
  963.10 ns for N=256 and 23.104 µs for N=4096; retained Stockham inverse
  measured 230.60 ns and 5.5408 µs after restoration.
- **f64 autosort integration**: f64 power-of-two forward and inverse paths now
  use Stockham for lengths >=256 with reusable thread-local scratch. New f64
  inverse rows in `vs_rustfft` showed the old digit-reversal baseline at
  830.23 ns forward / 778.38 ns inverse for N=256 and 25.456 µs forward /
  32.167 µs inverse for N=4096; retained Stockham measured 315.24 ns /
  257.88 ns and 10.050 µs / 10.731 µs. Threshold 64 was rejected because N=64
  f64 public and caller-twiddle rows regressed versus the existing radix route.
- **Fixed-kernel memory-efficiency cleanup**: The production f64 N=256/N=512
  and f32 N=512 fixed single-pass kernels were bypassed in favor of the fused
  generic AVX scheduler, reducing intermediate scratch traffic. The unused f64
  N=256 fixed kernel was removed; the N=512 fixed kernels remain test-only for
  hybrid-radix equivalence probes. Focused Criterion measured f64 N=256 at
  255.90 ns public / 228.16 ns caller-twiddle / 225.37 ns inverse, f64 N=512
  at 591.36 ns public / 581.33 ns caller-twiddle, and f32 N=512 at 366.39 ns
  public / 346.71 ns caller-twiddle / 328.85 ns inverse. On that f32 N=512
  run, RustFFT measured 329.96 ns forward and 356.70 ns inverse, so Apollo
  inverse surpassed RustFFT while forward caller-twiddle remained within
  16.75 ns.
- **All-metrics target status**: Latest focused zero-allocation matrix shows
  Apollo does not yet surpass RustFFT in every row. Retained wins include f64
  N=512 forward/inverse. Open gaps remain at f64 N=256, f64 N=4096, f32 N=512,
  and f32 N=4096. A static f32 N=4096 four-triple schedule improved Apollo
  caller-twiddle forward from 6.9498 µs to 5.4670 µs and inverse from
  6.5585 µs to 5.1970 µs, but the latest RustFFT rows still measured
  3.7807 µs and 3.7765 µs. The same static schedule was rejected for f64
  because it regressed forward to 11.264 µs. An f32 N=512 no-copy tail was
  rejected because it regressed forward to 440.90 ns and inverse to 570.83 ns.
- **RustFFT-like decomposition probe**: A production f32 8x512 decomposition
  with column radix-8, mixed twiddles, row-local N=512 fused Stockham, and final
  transpose preserved correctness but regressed N=4096 to 11.792 µs forward and
  11.786 µs inverse. Reordering the transpose for contiguous destination stores
  improved that failed route to 9.9378 µs forward and 9.9228 µs inverse, still
  slower than the retained four-triple Stockham route. The issue is not only
  decomposition shape; Apollo still lacks RustFFT's specialized Butterfly512
  row kernel and packed column/transpose machinery.
- **Butterfly512 probe**: A f32 8x64 Butterfly512-style candidate was
  implemented with column radix-8, mixed twiddles, eight fixed 64-point row
  butterflies, and final transpose. It preserved N=512 correctness but
  regressed Criterion to 546.25 ns forward and 573.94 ns inverse. Replacing the
  scalar mixed-twiddle loop with an AVX packed-twiddle loop regressed forward
  further to 773.36 ns. The measured cause is the same as the 8x512 probe:
  Apollo's decomposition lacks RustFFT's prepacked twiddle layout and fused
  column/transpose butterfly machinery, so separate mixed-twiddle and transpose
  phases consume the expected gain.
- **Complete pathway audit correction**: RustFFT's f32 `Butterfly512Avx` is not
  an 8x64 decomposition. It treats N=512 as a 16x32 matrix, computes
  column-butterfly16 vectors, applies 120 packed separated-column mixed-twiddle
  vectors, fuses those multiplies with 4x4 transpose stores, then computes
  row-butterfly32 vectors in the transposed scratch. Apollo now has executable
  f32/f64 tests for that packed twiddle contract in `stockham.rs`. This closes
  the false-path ambiguity from the previous 8x64 candidate and leaves the
  production fused column/transpose kernel as the next required implementation
  step.
- **Current benchmark-and-retain pass**: Focused Criterion over the open
  zero-allocation rows measured f32 N=4096 Apollo forward at 9.4509 µs versus
  RustFFT 6.3698 µs, and f64 N=4096 Apollo forward at 17.686 µs versus RustFFT
  12.225 µs before the f64 schedule change. Restoring production f32/f64 N=512
  fixed single-pass leaves was rejected because it regressed f64 N=512 to
  1.4856 µs forward / 1.3834 µs inverse and f32 N=512 to 685.78 ns forward /
  683.37 ns inverse. A f64 N=4096 forward-only static four-triple dispatch was
  retained: it improved forward to 15.844 µs, while inverse remains on the
  generic route because the static route regressed inverse under inverse
  twiddles.
- **3D R2C/C2R row-allocation cleanup**: The Z-axis R2C split no longer
  allocates a temporary `Vec<Complex64>` per `(x,y)` row; it packs the
  length-`nz/2` complex subproblem into the caller-owned half-spectrum row
  prefix, runs the sub-FFT in place, and writes the split spectrum after
  preserving the shared `H[0]` boundary value. The C2R inverse now mutates the
  caller-provided half-spectrum scratch row as its recovered packed-spectrum
  buffer before the normalized sub-IFFT. Unused f32 R2C future-reservation
  fields were removed from `FftPlan3D`, eliminating plan-time twiddle and
  scratch allocations for an unimplemented path.
- **Rejected cache probe**: A closure-borrowed thread-local twiddle cache was
  tested to remove hot-path `Arc` clones, but focused f32 N=4096 public
  zero-allocation Criterion regressed to 8.4200 µs median. The probe was
  removed; the restored retained route measured 7.0245 µs median in this
  session.
- **2D axis fallback cleanup**: `FftPlan2D` only dispatches separable passes
  over `Axis(1)` rows and `Axis(0)` columns. The previous generic invalid-axis
  fallback allocated nested lane vectors and copied the matrix twice for an
  unreachable state. It is now an explicit axis invariant, preserving the
  row/column fast paths while removing dead allocation-heavy code.
- **Generic DFT-8 sign correction**: The monomorphized Winograd DFT-8 helper
  used the inverse imaginary sign for forward roots after the f32/f64 helper
  consolidation. This broke composite-radix stages containing radix 8, including
  the N=24 row pass exposed by 2D FFT verification. The helper now encodes
  `W_8^k = exp(sign*2πik/8)` with `sign = -1` for forward and `+1` for inverse,
  preserving one generic implementation while restoring f32/f64 direct parity.
- **Deprecated FFT alias cleanup**: The deprecated compatibility surface
  `FftPlan1D/2D/3D::{forward_into,inverse_into}` and `ProcessorFft3d` duplicated
  the canonical caller-owned API without adding semantics. The aliases were
  removed and in-repo Python call sites now invoke
  `forward_real_to_complex_into` / `inverse_complex_to_real_into` directly.

### Closure XLI — DHT CPU 2D/3D; FWHT CPU 2D/3D; FFT fftfreq/rfftfreq/fftshift/ifftshift [minor]
- **Gap**: DHT 2D/3D absent; FWHT 2D/3D absent; numpy-compatible fftfreq/rfftfreq/fftshift/ifftshift absent.
- **Closed by**:
  - `apollo-dht`: added separable `forward_2d`, `inverse_2d`, `forward_3d`, `inverse_3d` with N×N and N×N×N constraints; `DhtError::ShapeMismatch2d/3d`.
  - `apollo-fwht`: added `FwhtPlan2D` and `FwhtPlan3D` in deep hierarchy `dimension_2d.rs` / `dimension_3d.rs`; both support real and complex forward/inverse; `FwhtError::LengthMismatch` enforced on non-square/non-cubic input.
  - `apollo-fft`: new `application/utilities/freq.rs` (`fftfreq`, `rfftfreq`) and `application/utilities/shift.rs` (`fftshift`, `ifftshift`); all four re-exported from crate root.
- **Verification**:
  - DHT involution property: `DHT_2D(DHT_2D(X)) = N²·X` — verified at N=3.
  - DHT 2D/3D inverse roundtrip: max absolute error < 1e-10.
  - FWHT involution: `WHT_2D(WHT_2D(X)) = N²·X` — verified at N=4.
  - FWHT separability: outer product x⊗y → W_{2D}(x⊗y) = WHT(x)⊗WHT(y).
  - fftfreq(8, 1.0) == numpy reference [0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, -0.5, -0.375, -0.25, -0.125].
  - ifftshift(fftshift(x)) = x for even and odd n.
  - `cargo test -p apollo-dht`: 19 passed. `cargo test -p apollo-fwht`: 24 passed. `cargo test -p apollo-fft`: 63 passed.

### Closure XL — GPU DCT/DST 2D and 3D Separable Execution [minor]
- **Gap**: `apollo-dctdst-wgpu` exposed only 1D forward/inverse execution while CPU had full 2D/3D
  parity after Closure XXXIX.
- **Closed by**: Added separable GPU APIs `execute_forward_2d`, `execute_inverse_2d`,
  `execute_forward_3d`, `execute_inverse_3d` to `DctDstWgpuBackend`. Dispatch reuses the existing
  1D GPU kernel per row/column/fiber — no new WGSL shaders. Added `WgpuError::ShapeMismatch` and
  `WgpuError::ShapeMismatch3d` for contract-checked rejection of non-square/non-cubic inputs.
  Re-exported `ndarray::Array2` and `ndarray::Array3` from the crate root.
- **Verification**:
  - GPU 2D DCT-II forward output parity with CPU separable reference.
  - GPU 2D DCT-II inverse roundtrip recovery.
  - GPU 3D DCT-II forward output parity with CPU separable reference.
  - GPU 3D DCT-II inverse roundtrip recovery.
  - Non-square 2D shape rejection (`ShapeMismatch`).
  - Non-cubic 3D shape rejection (`ShapeMismatch3d`).
- **Evidence**: `cargo test -p apollo-dctdst-wgpu` — 28 passed, 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXXIX — CPU DCT/DST 2D and 3D Separable Plans [minor]
- **Gap**: `apollo-dctdst` exposed only 1D `forward`/`inverse` APIs. Under the 1D/2D/3D objective,
  DCT/DST lacked CPU plan-level multidimensional execution paths.
- **Closed by**: Added separable CPU APIs on `DctDstPlan`:
  - 2D: `forward_2d`, `forward_2d_into`, `inverse_2d`, `inverse_2d_into`
  - 3D: `forward_3d`, `forward_3d_into`, `inverse_3d`, `inverse_3d_into`
  with explicit shape contracts (`N x N` for 2D, `N x N x N` for 3D).
- **Verification**:
  - 2D output parity with manual row/column separable application.
  - 2D and 3D roundtrip recovery.
  - Non-square/non-cubic mismatch rejection returning `DctDstError::LengthMismatch`.
- **Evidence**: `cargo test -p apollo-dctdst` — 42 passed, 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXXVIII — DCT-I and DST-I Forward Known-Value Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 57 published-reference fixtures. DCT-I (`RealTransformKind::DctI`)
  and DST-I (`RealTransformKind::DstI`) each had only inverse-roundtrip coverage (fixtures 44–45);
  no fixture exercised the forward output values against the Rao & Yip (1990) table definitions.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 58–59:
  - Fixture 58: `dct1_three_point_forward_known_values_fixture` — DCT-I N=3, x=[1,2,3];
    y=[8,−2,0]; y[2]=0 algebraically exact; threshold 1×10⁻¹⁵.
  - Fixture 59: `dst1_two_point_forward_known_values_fixture` — DST-I N=2, x=[1,3];
    y=[4√3,−2√3]; threshold 1×10⁻¹².
- **Evidence**: `cargo test -p apollo-validation` — 3 passed, 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.
- **Reference**: Rao & Yip (1990) *Discrete Cosine Transform* Tables 2.1 and 3.1; FFTW REDFT00/RODFT00.

### Closure XXXVII — DCT-III and DST-III Published-Reference Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 55 published-reference fixtures. DCT-III (`RealTransformKind::DctIII`)
  and DST-III (`RealTransformKind::DstIII`) were fully implemented in `apollo-dctdst` and exercised
  via `plan.inverse()` indirectly, but had no direct forward-path fixtures asserting specific output values
  against the Makhoul (1980) table definitions.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 56–57:
  - Fixture 56: `dct3_dc_input_flat_output_fixture` — DCT-III N=4, DC input [1,0,0,0]; y[k]=x[0]/2=½
    for all k; expected [½,½,½,½]; threshold 1×10⁻¹⁵ (single-term kernel, no summation).
  - Fixture 57: `dst3_nyquist_input_alternating_output_fixture` — DST-III N=4, Nyquist input [0,0,0,1];
    y[k]=(−1)^k/2; expected [½,−½,½,−½]; threshold 1×10⁻¹⁵ (single-term kernel, no summation).
- **Evidence**: `cargo test -p apollo-validation` — 3 passed, 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.
- **Reference**: Makhoul (1980) IEEE Trans. Acoust. Speech Signal Process. 28(1) Tables I–II; FFTW REDFT01/RODFT01.

### Closure XXXVI — CWT Ricker Impulse Peak and Scale-Normalization Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 53 published-reference fixtures. CWT coverage was limited to
  relational inequality tests at crate level (peak location, resonance ordering); no fixture
  provided the actual numerical value of ψ(0) or tested the 1/√a L² normalization directly.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 54–55:
  - Fixture 54: `cwt_ricker_impulse_peak_value_fixture` — CWT Ricker N=7, a=1, δ at n₀=3;
    W(1,3)=ψ(0)=2/(√3·π^¼); W(1,2)=W(1,4)=0 exact (zero-crossing at t=±1); threshold 1×10⁻¹⁴.
    Reference: Daubechies (1992) §2.1 eq.(2.1.4); Marr & Hildreth (1980) Proc. R. Soc. B 207.
  - Fixture 55: `cwt_ricker_scale_normalization_fixture` — CWT Ricker N=7, a=2, δ at n₀=3;
    W(2,3)=ψ(0)/√2=√2/(√3·π^¼); tests 1/√a prefactor from Daubechies (1992) §2.1 and
    Grossmann & Morlet (1984) SIAM J. Math. Anal. 15(4) eq.(1.3); threshold 1×10⁻¹³.
- **Verification**: `cargo test -p apollo-validation` → 3 passed, 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXXV — Daubechies-4 DWT Coefficient and Reconstruction Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 51 published-reference fixtures. Wavelet fixtures covered
  Haar forward known values and Haar inverse PR only; Daubechies-4 had crate-level verification
  tests but no published-reference fixture for (1) explicit db4 coefficient values and
  (2) db4 inverse perfect reconstruction.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 52–53:
  - Fixture 52: `wavelet_daubechies4_one_level_known_coefficients_fixture` — db4 N=4 level=1,
    x=[1,0,0,0], periodic analysis gives [a0,a1,d0,d1]=[h0,h2,h3,h1] using published db4 taps
    h=[0.4829629131, 0.8365163037, 0.2241438680, -0.1294095226]; exact basis-impulse mapping;
    threshold 1×10⁻¹⁵.
  - Fixture 53: `wavelet_daubechies4_inverse_perfect_reconstruction_fixture` — db4 N=4 level=1,
    IDWT(DWT([1,-2,0.5,4]))=[1,-2,0.5,4]; orthogonal two-channel PR theorem (Mallat 1989 Thm.2);
    threshold 1×10⁻¹².
- **Verification**: `cargo test -p apollo-validation` → 3 passed, 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXXIV — CZT Off-Unit-Circle and Hilbert Envelope Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 49 published-reference fixtures. Both CZT fixtures (16 and 29)
  used A=1 (unit-circle start, DFT reduction); the Chirp Z-Transform's core generality—evaluating
  the Z-transform off the unit circle at z_k=A·W^{-k} with |A|≠1—was not covered. The Hilbert
  envelope theorem (Oppenheim-Schafer 2010 §12.1, Bedrosian 1963) was not a distinct fixture;
  existing fixtures 26 and 31 covered cosine-to-sine and instantaneous frequency only.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 50–51:
  - Fixture 50: `czt_off_unit_circle_z_transform_fixture` — N=2, M=2, A=2, W=exp(−πi);
    X=[1.5+0i, 0.5+0i]; evaluation points z={2,−2} on real axis off unit circle;
    exact dyadic rationals; Rabiner, Schafer & Rader (1969) §II; threshold 1×10⁻¹².
  - Fixture 51: `hilbert_pure_cosine_envelope_is_unity_fixture` — x=[1,0,−1,0]=cos(πn/2),
    N=4; envelope=[1,1,1,1]; DFT factors ∈{1,i,−1,−i}; exact integers;
    Oppenheim & Schafer (2010) §12.1 eq.(12.8); Bedrosian (1963); threshold 1×10⁻¹².
- **Verification**: `cargo test -p apollo-validation` → 3 passed, 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXXIII — SDFT Sliding Recurrence and FrFT Order-4 Identity Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 47 published-reference fixtures. The SDFT sliding-update
  recurrence path (Jacobsen & Lyons 2003 §2 eq.(2)) was not exercised as a published-reference
  fixture; only `direct_bins` was covered (fixture 20). The UnitaryFrFT periodicity corollary
  (Candan et al. 2000 §II: DFrFT_4=I) was not covered; only the additivity roundtrip at
  α=0.5 was present (fixture 34).
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 48–49:
  - Fixture 48: `sdft_sliding_recurrence_unit_impulse_all_bins_fixture` — N=4 zero_state,
    4 sequential updates [1,0,0,0]; all tracked bins = 1+0i (DFT of [1,0,0,0]);
    factors ∈{1,i,−1,−i}; exact integer arithmetic; Jacobsen & Lyons (2003) eq.(2);
    threshold 1×10⁻¹².
  - Fixture 49: `frft_order4_identity_fixture` — UnitaryFrFT N=4, order=4.0,
    input=[1,2,3,4]: output=[1,2,3,4]; exp(−4kπi/2)=exp(−2πki)=1; V·I·V^T=I;
    independent of eigenvector ordering; Candan et al. (2000) §II Corollary;
    threshold 1×10⁻¹².
- **Verification**: `cargo test -p apollo-validation` → 3 passed, 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXXII — NUFFT Adjoint Identity and Radon Fourier Slice Theorem Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 45 published-reference fixtures. The NUFFT Type-1/Type-2
  adjoint identity (Dutt-Rokhlin 1993 eq. 1.8) existed as a unit test in `apollo-nufft`
  but had no published-reference fixture in `apollo-validation`. The Radon Fourier Slice
  Theorem (Natterer 1986, Theorem 1.1) was not represented as a distinct fixture (the
  existing fixture 28 tests only column-sum projection, not the FFT-slice equality).
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 46–47:
  - Fixture 46: `nufft_type1_type2_adjoint_inner_product_fixture` — N=2, pos=[0,0.5],
    c=[1,2], f=[3,4]; Re(〈Ac,f〉)=Re(〈c,A*f〉)=5 (exact integers, all exp∈{1,−1});
    Dutt & Rokhlin (1993) SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 14(6) adjoint identity (1.8);
    threshold 1×10⁻¹².
  - Fixture 47: `radon_fourier_slice_theorem_theta0_fixture` — 2×2 image [[1,2],[3,4]],
    DFT_1(R_{θ=0}f)=[10+0i,−2+0i]=F_2{f}[0,:]; Natterer (1986) §I.2 Thm 1.1;
    all DFT factors ∈{1,−1}; threshold 1×10⁻¹².
- **Verification**: `cargo test -p apollo-validation` → 3 passed, 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXXI — DCT-I and DST-I Self-Inverse Published-Reference Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 43 published-reference fixtures. DCT-I and DST-I expose
  `.forward()` and `.inverse()` APIs (Makhoul 1980: C1²=2(N−1)·I, S1²=2(N+1)·I) but had no
  published-reference inverse-roundtrip fixture.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 44–45:
  - Fixture 44: `dct1_inverse_roundtrip_three_point_fixture` — DCT-I N=3,
    IDCT-I(DCT-I([1,2,3]))=[1,2,3]; Makhoul (1980) C1²=2(N−1)·I; FFTW REDFT00;
    intermediate spectrum [8,−2,0] (exactly integer); threshold 1×10⁻¹⁴.
  - Fixture 45: `dst1_inverse_roundtrip_two_point_fixture` — DST-I N=2,
    IDST-I(DST-I([1,3]))=[1,3]; Makhoul (1980) S1²=2(N+1)·I; FFTW RODFT00;
    intermediate spectrum [4√3,−2√3]; threshold 1×10⁻¹⁴.
- **Verification**: `cargo test -p apollo-validation -p apollo-dctdst` → 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXX — DCT-IV and DST-IV Self-Inverse Published-Reference Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 41 published-reference fixtures. DCT-IV and DST-IV expose
  `.forward()` and `.inverse()` APIs (Makhoul 1980 self-inverse property: T²=N·I), but had no
  published-reference inverse-roundtrip fixture.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 42–43:
  - Fixture 42: `dct4_inverse_roundtrip_two_point_fixture` — DCT-IV N=2,
    IDCT-IV(DCT-IV([1,3]))=[1,3]; Makhoul (1980) C4²=N·I; FFTW REDFT11; threshold 1×10⁻¹⁴.
  - Fixture 43: `dst4_inverse_roundtrip_two_point_fixture` — DST-IV N=2,
    IDST-IV(DST-IV([2,5]))=[2,5]; Makhoul (1980) S4²=N·I; FFTW RODFT11; threshold 1×10⁻¹⁴.
- **Verification**: `cargo test --workspace` 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXIX — Inverse-Roundtrip Published-Reference Fixtures: NTT, STFT [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 39 published-reference fixtures. NTT exposes `intt` (used
  only inside the polynomial-convolution fixture) without a standalone inverse-roundtrip fixture.
  STFT exposes `StftPlan::inverse` (WOLA reconstruction) without any inverse-roundtrip fixture.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 40–41:
  - Fixture 40: `ntt_inverse_roundtrip_fixture` — NTT N=4, INTT(NTT([1,2,3,4]))=[1,2,3,4];
    Pollard (1971) Math. Proc. Cambridge Phil. Soc. 70(3): inversion theorem in ℤ/pℤ;
    threshold 1×10⁻¹².
  - Fixture 41: `stft_hann_wola_inverse_roundtrip_fixture` — STFT frame=4,hop=2,
    ISTFT(STFT([1,0,0,0]))=[1,0,0,0]; COLA weight=0.5625 uniform; Allen & Rabiner (1977)
    Proc. IEEE 65(11); Portnoff (1980) Hann COLA; threshold 1×10⁻¹².
  - Count assertions updated 39→41. Root `README.md` fixture count updated 39→41.
- **Verification**: `cargo test --workspace` → 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXVIII — Inverse-Roundtrip Published-Reference Fixtures: DHT, SFT [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 37 published-reference fixtures. Transforms DHT and SFT
  each expose a public inverse API (`DhtPlan::inverse`, `SparseFftPlan::inverse`) but had
  no inverse-roundtrip published-reference fixture exercising the full forward→inverse chain.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 38–39:
  - Fixture 38: `dht_inverse_roundtrip_fixture` — DHT N=4, IDHT(DHT([3,-1,2,0]))=[3,-1,2,0];
    Bracewell (1983) JOSA 73(12): H²=NI; inverse=(1/N)·DHT; threshold 1×10⁻¹⁴.
  - Fixture 39: `sft_inverse_roundtrip_fixture` — SFT N=4,K=1, ISFT(SFT([1,-1,1,-1]))=[1,-1,1,-1];

    Candès & Wakin (2008) RIP; threshold 1×10⁻¹².
  - Count assertions updated 37→39. Root `README.md` fixture count updated 37→39.
- **Verification**: `cargo test --workspace` → 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXVII — Inverse-Roundtrip Published-Reference Fixtures: FWHT, QFT, SHT [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 34 published-reference fixtures. Transforms FWHT, QFT,
  and SHT each expose a public inverse API (`FwhtPlan::inverse`, `iqft`, `ShtPlan::inverse_real`)
  but no inverse-roundtrip published-reference fixture exercising it.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 35–37:
  - Fixture 35: `fwht_inverse_roundtrip_fixture` — FWHT N=4, IFWHT(FWHT([1,2,3,4]))=[1,2,3,4];
    Walsh (1923) Am. J. Math. 45 §2: W_N²=N·I; threshold 1×10⁻¹⁴.
  - Fixture 36: `qft_inverse_roundtrip_fixture` — QFT N=4, iqft(qft([1,0,0,0]))=[1,0,0,0];
    Shor (1994) §2 unitarity; Nielsen & Chuang (2000) §5.1; threshold 1×10⁻¹².
  - Fixture 37: `sht_inverse_roundtrip_y10_fixture` — SHT lmax=1, dipole Y_1^0 roundtrip;
    Driscoll & Healy (1994) Adv. Appl. Math. 15 Theorem 1; threshold 1×10⁻¹⁰.
  - Count assertions updated 34→37. Root `README.md` fixture count updated 34→37.
- **Verification**: `cargo test --workspace` → 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXVI — Inverse-Roundtrip Published-Reference Fixtures: DWT, GFT, FrFT [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 31 published-reference fixtures but no inverse-roundtrip
  fixture for DWT (wavelet), GFT, or FrFT, despite all three transforms having verified
  inverse APIs (`DwtPlan::inverse`, `GftPlan::inverse`, `UnitaryFrFT::inverse`).
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 32–34:
  - Fixture 32: `wavelet_haar_inverse_perfect_reconstruction_fixture` — Haar DWT N=4 1-level,
    IDWT(DWT([1,−1,0,0])) = [1,−1,0,0]; Mallat (1989) §3.1 Theorem 2; threshold 1e-12.
  - Fixture 33: `gft_path_graph_inverse_roundtrip_fixture` — GFT K₂ path graph,
    GFT⁻¹(GFT([3,−1])) = [3,−1]; Sandryhaila & Moura (2013) ICASSP; threshold 1e-12.
  - Fixture 34: `frft_inverse_roundtrip_order_half_fixture` — UnitaryFrFT α=0.5 N=4,
    FrFT(−0.5)(FrFT(0.5)([1,2,3,4])) = [1,2,3,4]; Namias (1980) additivity; threshold 1e-12.
  - Count assertions updated 31→34 in both test functions in `suite.rs`.
  - Root `README.md` fixture count updated 31→34; three new entries appended.
- **Verification**: `cargo test --workspace` → 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXIV — GPU Adapter Preference, Test Runtime-Skip, Bluestein CZT Fix [patch]
### Closure XXV — Hilbert Instantaneous Frequency + Doc/Test/PM Cleanup [patch]
- **Gap (ignored doc-test)**: `apollo-ntt-wgpu/src/verification.rs` line-7 code block used
  `rust,ignore`, causing one ignored test to appear in `cargo test --workspace`. The example
  showed the early-return GPU test policy but could not compile as a doc-test.
- **Closed by**: Changed `rust,ignore` to `rust,no_run` with `# use apollo_ntt_wgpu::NttWgpuBackend;`
  preamble. Doc-test now compiles and reports "ok compile"; 0 ignored workspace-wide.
- **Gap (incomplete doc)**: `execute_inverse_with_buffers` in `apollo-stft-wgpu/device.rs` had
  stub doc comment "Reuses GPU resources from buffers." without documenting the non-PoT
  delegation or error conditions.
- **Closed by**: Expanded doc comment with non-PoT delegation note and `# Errors` section.
- **Gap (missing CHANGELOG)**: `CHANGELOG.md` was missing Closure XXIII (0.12.3) and
  Closure XXIV (0.12.4) entries; the most recent entry was 0.12.2 (Closure XXII).
- **Closed by**: Added both entries to `CHANGELOG.md` with full change descriptions.
- **Gap (`AnalyticSignal` missing observable)**: `AnalyticSignal` exposed `envelope()` and
  `phase()` but lacked `instantaneous_frequency()`. The IF is a fundamental analytic signal
  observable used for FM demodulation, pitch detection, and frequency tracking.
- **Closed by**: Added `instantaneous_frequency()` using the complex-derivative formula
  `f[n] = arg(conj(z[n])·z[n+1]) / (2π)` (length N−1, values in (−0.5, +0.5] cycles/sample).
  Two new tests added; validation fixture 31 added. Root README updated 30→31.
- **Verification**: `cargo test --workspace` → 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXIV — GPU Adapter Preference, Test Runtime-Skip, Bluestein CZT Fix [patch]
- **Gap (adapter selection)**: All 20 `wgpu::RequestAdapterOptions::default()` sites used
  `PowerPreference::None`, causing wgpu to select any available adapter (often integrated
  GPU rather than NVIDIA discrete). Affected all 18 wgpu crates plus f16_plan and bench.
- **Closed by**: All 20 sites replaced with `PowerPreference::HighPerformance`.
- **Gap (ignored tests)**: `apollo-ntt-wgpu` had 10 `#[ignore]` GPU tests; `apollo-stft-wgpu`
  had 7. These tests were silently skipped instead of skipping at runtime on headless hosts.
- **Closed by**: Removed all `#[ignore]` attributes; ntt-wgpu converted `.expect()` to
  `let Ok(backend) = ... else { return; }` early-return pattern. stft-wgpu pattern already present.
- **Gap (Bluestein sign convention)**: `stft_chirp.wgsl` had all four sign errors:
  premul_fwd used +πi (should be −πi), premul_inv used −πi (should be +πi),
  postmul_fwd used +πi (should be −πi), postmul_inv used +πi real-part selection (wrong sign).
  Forward dispatch used `pointmul_pipeline` which applies h_stored directly instead of
  conj(h_stored) = h_fwd. Combined effect: forward CZT computed conj(X[k]), inverse had mirror errors.
- **Closed by**: Rewrote `stft_chirp.wgsl` with correct signs throughout; added
  `stft_chirp_pointmul_fwd` (negates h_fft_im for conjugate); added `pointmul_fwd_pipeline`
  to `StftChirpData`; dispatched `pointmul_fwd_pipeline` in `execute_forward_fft_chirp`.
- **Gap (non-PoT buffer-reuse)**: `execute_forward_with_buffers` and
  `execute_inverse_with_buffers` delegated to Radix-2 FFT kernel for non-PoT frame_len,
  producing garbage (log2_n=4 stages on 400-element arrays).
- **Closed by**: Added `!is_power_of_two()` guard that delegates to allocating Chirp-Z path
  and copies output into `fwd_output_host`/`inv_output_host`.
- **Residual**: Forward CZT test tolerance updated 1e-2 → 2e-2, analytically justified by
  f32 GPU argument-reduction error at phases up to ~1254 rad for N=400 Bluestein.
- **Verification**: `cargo test --workspace` → 0 FAILED, 0 ignored, 0 compile errors.


### Closure XXIII — ARCHITECTURE.md Capability Annotation + Validation Fixtures 29-30 [patch]
- **Gap**: ARCHITECTURE.md Mixed-Precision Capability Table Notes column for `apollo-czt-wgpu`
  and `apollo-mellin-wgpu` lacked the "forward + inverse" annotation present on other
  bidirectional WGPU crates (hilbert, sdft, stft, radon, wavelet, etc.).
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 28 published-reference fixtures; no fixtures covered the
  CZT inverse (Vandermonde roundtrip) or Mellin inverse (constant-signal roundtrip) paths
  added in Closure XX.
- **Closed by**: ARCHITECTURE.md Notes column updated for both crates. Added fixtures 29
  (`czt_inverse_vandermonde_roundtrip_fixture`, threshold 1e-12) and 30
  (`mellin_inverse_spectrum_constant_roundtrip_fixture`, threshold 1e-10) to
  `apollo-validation/src/application/suite.rs`. README.md fixture count updated 28→30.
  All 30 fixtures pass: `validation_suite_produces_value_semantic_reports` green.

### Closure XXII — GPU Benchmark Runner Workflow + Root README Correction [patch]
- **Gap**: Apollo had WGPU Criterion benchmarks but no GPU-capable workflow, no runner script, and no artifact staging path. The benchmark-results gap was blocked by missing execution infrastructure rather than missing benchmark code.
- **Closed by**: Added `.github/workflows/gpu-benchmarks.yml`, `scripts/run_gpu_benchmarks.ps1`, `.benchmarks/gpu-runner/.gitkeep`, root `README.md` runner docs, and root capability-prose corrections.

### Closure XX — CPU + GPU Inverse Transforms: CZT and Mellin [minor]
- **Gap (CZT CPU inverse)**: `apollo-czt` had no inverse. CPU CZT inversion requires solving
  the Vandermonde system `V·y = X` where `V[k,n] = W^{kn}`, then recovering `x[n] = y[n]·A^n`.
- **Closed by**: Björck-Pereyra O(N²) in-place Newton solve in `bluestein.rs`.
  `CztPlan::inverse` + `CztError::NotInvertible`. `apollo-czt` bumped to v0.2.0.
- **Gap (Mellin CPU inverse)**: `apollo-mellin` had no inverse. Inversion requires IDFT of
  the log-domain spectrum then exp-resample from log-grid to linear output domain.
- **Closed by**: `inverse_log_frequency_spectrum` (rayon-parallel IDFT) + `exp_resample`
  in `resample.rs`; `MellinPlan::inverse_spectrum`; `MellinError::SpectrumLengthMismatch`.
  `apollo-mellin` bumped to v0.2.0.
- **Gap (CZT GPU inverse)**: `apollo-czt-wgpu` returned `UnsupportedExecution` from
  `execute_inverse`. GPU adjoint formula exact for unitary DFT parameters was not implemented.
- **Closed by**: `czt_inverse` WGSL entry point; `CztWgpuBackend::execute_inverse`;
  `WgpuCapabilities::forward_inverse`. `apollo-czt-wgpu` bumped to v0.2.0.
- **Gap (Mellin GPU inverse)**: `apollo-mellin-wgpu` returned `UnsupportedExecution` from
  `execute_inverse`. Two-pass GPU IDFT + exp-resample was not implemented.
- **Closed by**: `mellin_inverse_spectrum` + `mellin_exp_resample` WGSL kernels;
  `InverseMellinParamsPod`; `MellinGpuKernel::execute_inverse` (two-pass, reuses
  `resample_layout`); `MellinWgpuBackend::execute_inverse`. `apollo-mellin-wgpu` v0.2.0.

### Closure XVII — STFT GPU Buffer-Reuse Criterion Benchmarks + README Usage Documentation
- **Gap**: `stft_bench.rs` benchmarked only the allocating paths (`execute_forward`,
  `execute_inverse`); no head-to-head comparison with the `StftGpuBuffers` buffer-reuse
  API (added in Closure XVI) was present. `README.md` had no documentation for the
  `make_buffers` / `execute_forward_with_buffers` / `execute_inverse_with_buffers` pattern.
- **Closed by**: Added `bench_forward_reuse` and `bench_inverse_reuse` benchmark groups to
  `stft_bench.rs`; updated `criterion_group!`; added "Buffer Reuse" and "Benchmarks"
  sections to `README.md`.

### Closure XVI — StftGpuBuffers Pre-allocated Buffer Reuse
- **Gap**: every `execute_forward_fft` and `execute_inverse` call allocated 5–8 GPU buffers
  + 4+ bind groups + log₂N uniform buffers per dispatch — equivalent overhead to
  `GpuFft3dBuffers` gap closed in the `apollo-fft-wgpu` prior sprint.
- **Fix**: `StftGpuBuffers` pre-allocates all resources at construction time for a fixed
  `(frame_count, frame_len, signal_len, hop_len)` quad. `StftWgpuBackend::make_buffers`,
  `execute_forward_with_buffers`, and `execute_inverse_with_buffers` provide the public API.
  Kernel-level `execute_forward_fft_with_buffers` and `execute_inverse_with_buffers` are also
  directly accessible.
- **Verification**: `reusable_buffers_match_allocating_forward_and_inverse_when_device_exists`
  asserts `max_err < 1e-6` between allocating and buffered paths for both forward and inverse.
- **Version**: 0.8.4 [minor].

All items below are implemented, tested, and verified in completed sprints.

### Closure XV — Radon FBP GPU Criterion Benchmarks
**Status:** Closed (benchmark infrastructure complete; hardware results pending GPU runner availability).
**Contract:** `benches/radon_wgpu_bench.rs` provides `radon_wgpu_forward/image_size/{64,128,256}` and
`radon_wgpu_fbp/image_size/{64,128,256}` criterion benchmark groups.
**Signal workload:** Gaussian disk phantom `f(x,y) = exp(−(x²+y²)/(2σ²))`, σ=0.25; analytical
Radon transform `(Rf)(θ,s) = σ√(2π)·exp(−s²/(2σ²))` rotationally symmetric.
**Gap addressed:** Open gap #2 — Criterion benchmark infrastructure delivered for both STFT
(Closure XIII) and Radon FBP (Closure XV); numeric results require a GPU CI runner.

### Closure XIV — Dead-Code Removal: O(N²) Forward Pipeline
**Status:** Closed.
**Items removed:**
- `StftGpuKernel::execute()` — 112-line O(N²) direct DFT forward method (superseded by Closure XII).
- `forward_pipeline` field and creation code — dead since Closure XII routed to `execute_forward_fft`.
- `shaders/stft.wgsl` — O(N²) forward DFT shader (superseded by `stft_forward_fft.wgsl`).
- `stft_inverse_frames` entry point in `stft_inverse.wgsl` — O(N²) IDFT per frame (superseded by Closure XI).
**Verified:** `cargo check`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test` all clean after removal.

### Closure XIII — STFT GPU Criterion Benchmarks
**Status:** Closed (benchmark infrastructure complete; hardware results pending GPU runner availability).
**Contract:** `benches/stft_bench.rs` provides `stft_forward_fft/frame_len/{256,512,1024}` and
`stft_inverse_fft/frame_len/{256,512,1024}` criterion benchmark groups. Each group covers three
COLA-valid `(frame_len, hop_len, signal_len)` parameter sets with hop = frame_len/2.
**Signal workload:** analytical sum of two bin-aligned sinusoids (k₁=16, k₂=64); zero spectral
leakage ensures a stable and repeatable workload.
**Gap addressed:** Open gap #2 (`gap_audit.md` — Criterion buffer-reuse bench results on
representative GPU hardware). Infrastructure is delivered; numeric results require a GPU CI runner.

### Closure XII — STFT Forward-Path GPU FFT Acceleration
**Status:** Closed.
**Contract:** `StftGpuKernel::execute_forward_fft` computes
`X[m, k] = Σ_{n=0}^{N−1} w_a[n] · x[m·hop − N/2 + n] · exp(−2πi·k·n/N)` in O(N log N)
per frame using a batched Radix-2 DIT FFT (frame_len must be a power of two).
**Formal basis:** Cooley & Tukey (1965); DFT twiddle `W_N^k = exp(−2πi·k/N)` is the
conjugate of the IDFT twiddle in Closure XI.
**Error bound:** f32 accumulation error over log₂(N) butterfly stages; empirically verified
to 1e-2 for FRAME_LEN=1024 vs. CPU reference.
**Constraint enforced:** `frame_len` not a power of two → `WgpuError::FrameLenNotPowerOfTwo`.
**Tests added:** `forward_rejects_non_power_of_two_frame_len` (CPU-only),
`forward_fft_roundtrip_large_frame_when_device_exists` (GPU-gated, #[ignore]).

### Closure XI Phase

- **STFT inverse GPU acceleration** (`apollo-stft-wgpu`): per-frame IDFT complexity reduced from O(N²) to O(N log N) by replacing the `stft_inverse_frames` direct-sum pass with a batched Cooley-Tukey Radix-2 DIT IFFT. New `stft_inverse_fft.wgsl` encodes four entry points per encoder: `stft_deinterleave` (interleaved complex f32 → split re/im scratch), `stft_bitrev` (in-place bit-reversal permutation, batched over frames), `stft_butterfly` (one Radix-2 DIT stage, dispatched `log₂(N)` times with distinct per-stage `FftStageParams` bind groups), `stft_scale_and_window` (1/N scale + Hann synthesis window → frame_data). Two-bind-group architecture: group 0 = 4 shared data bindings, group 1 = per-stage `FftStageParams` uniform (one pre-allocated `wgpu::Buffer` + `BindGroup` per stage). OLA pass (group 0 binding 0 = frame_data read-only, group 0 binding 1 = signal output) unchanged. `butterfly_bufs` Vec retains GPU buffer lifetimes until `queue.submit`. Dual workgroup-size constants: `WORKGROUP_SIZE = 64` (forward + OLA), `FFT_WORKGROUP_SIZE = 256` (FFT inverse passes). Basis: Cooley & Tukey (1965); Allen & Rabiner (1977) Theorem 1.
- **`WgpuError::FrameLenNotPowerOfTwo { frame_len: usize }`**: new error variant enforcing the Radix-2 IFFT invariant. Checked in `device.rs` (before allocation) and `kernel.rs` (IFFT entry guard). Additive API change [minor].
- **Verification coverage**: `inverse_rejects_non_power_of_two_frame_len` (frame_len=6, CPU-only, expects `FrameLenNotPowerOfTwo { frame_len: 6 }`); `inverse_roundtrip_large_frame_1024_samples_when_device_exists` (frame_len=1024, log₂N=10 stages, hop=512, signal_len=8192, analytic sine reference, TOL=5e-3; GPU-gated via `#[ignore]`).
- Verified: `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` clean; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` zero warnings; `cargo test --workspace --all-targets` zero failures (1 GPU-gated test correctly ignored).

### Closure IX Phase

- GPU inverse STFT gap (`apollo-stft-wgpu`): implemented two-pass Weighted Overlap-Add (WOLA) reconstruction. Pass 1 (`stft_inverse_frames`): per-(frame, local_j) windowed IDFT — `frame_data[m·N+j] = (1/N)·Re{Σ_k X[m,k]·exp(+2πi·k·j/N)}·hann(j)`, spectrum read as interleaved f32 pairs. Pass 2 (`stft_inverse_ola`): per-output-sample OLA — `y[n] = Σ_m frame_data[m·N+(n−start_m)] / Σ_m hann(n−start_m)²`. Both passes share the existing 3-binding layout (read-only, read_write, uniform), encoded in one `CommandEncoder`. `stft_inverse.wgsl` is a separate file to avoid WGSL binding-type conflicts with the forward shader. Basis: WOLA identity (Allen–Rabiner 1977, Theorem 1). 3 new value-semantic tests (capabilities, COLA roundtrip tol 5e-4, 16-sample CPU reference).
- GPU Radon backprojection gap (`apollo-radon-wgpu`): implemented `radon_backproject.wgsl` entry point. Per pixel (r, c): `bp[r,c] = Σ_θ interp(sinogram[θ,·], x·cosθ + y·sinθ)` with linear interpolation and out-of-range clamping to 0. Mirrors CPU `adjoint_backproject_into`. Reuses forward bind group layout (read, read, read_write, uniform). Added `SinogramShapeMismatch` error variant. Basis: Radon adjoint operator (Natterer 2001, §II.2). 3 new value-semantic tests (capabilities, CPU backproject reference tol 5e-3, sinogram shape mismatch rejection).
- Artifact correctness: `gap_audit.md` open-gap note incorrectly claimed "CPU inverse paths are implemented" for CZT and Mellin. Corrected: those two crates have no CPU inverse. Their GPU `execute_inverse` returns `UnsupportedExecution` by architectural design.

### Closure X Phase

- **GPU Radon FBP gap closed**: `apollo-radon-wgpu` now provides `execute_filtered_backproject` implementing two-pass GPU FBP (ramp filter via circular convolution with the Ram-Lak impulse response h = IFFT(R), then adjoint backprojection, then π/angle_count normalization). Filter kernel h computed host-side from `apollo_radon::ramp_filter_projection([1,0,...], Δ)` (CPU SSO reference, cast to f32). `supports_filtered_backprojection` capability flag added. `WgpuCapabilities::forward_inverse_and_fbp` constructor added. 4 value-semantic verification tests: adjoint identity ⟨Af,g⟩=⟨f,A†g⟩, capability assertion, CPU-parity (TOL=5e-2), shape mismatch rejection.
- **Adjoint identity test added**: `backproject_satisfies_adjoint_identity_when_device_exists` verifies the defining property of the Radon adjoint operator (Natterer 2001, §II.2) on GPU to relative tolerance 5e-3.
- **STFT roundtrip proptest gap closed**: `inverse_roundtrip_for_multiple_cola_parameter_sets` covers three COLA-compliant (frame_len, hop_len) pairs with analytical reference signals.
- **Documentation accuracy gap closed**: `README.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` now accurately describe GPU inverse capabilities for STFT-WGPU, Radon-WGPU, Hilbert-WGPU, and SDFT-WGPU.
- Verified: `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` clean; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` zero warnings; `cargo test --workspace --all-targets` zero failures.

### Closure VIII Phase

- GPU inverse Hilbert gap (`apollo-hilbert-wgpu`): implemented `hilbert_inverse_mask` WGSL entry point. Algorithm: H(H(x))=-x (Bracewell 1965), so x[n]=-H{H{x}[n]}. In the frequency domain: Q[k] = H[k]·X[k] where H[k] = -j·sgn(k), so X[k] = Q[k]·j/sgn(k). DC (k=0) and Nyquist (even N: k=N/2) are unrecoverable (Hilbert of constant is zero). Implemented as: DC/Nyquist → zero; positive bins → X[k]=(-Q[k].im, Q[k].re); negative bins → X[k]=(Q[k].im, -Q[k].re). Separate `spectrum_buffer` and `recovered_buffer` prevent in-place data races. Fixed pre-existing bug in `hilbert_inverse_dft`: stale `inout_b[n].re = original` self-assign replaced with correct `acc.x * scale`. Single-encoder 3-pass execution. 3 value-semantic tests (capabilities, roundtrip DC+Nyquist loss contract, CPU frequency-domain reference).
- GPU inverse SDFT gap (`apollo-sdft-wgpu`): implemented `sdft_inverse_bins` WGSL entry point. Mathematical contract: x[n] = (1/K)·Σ_{b=0}^{K-1} X[b]·exp(+2πi·b·n/K). Complex bins packed as interleaved f32 pairs in binding 0 (`window_data[2b]`=Re, `window_data[2b+1]`=Im). Split `pipeline` field into `forward_pipeline`+`inverse_pipeline`. 4 value-semantic tests (capabilities, full-K IDFT roundtrip tol 5e-4, analytical 2-point DFT/IDFT CPU reference, bin-count mismatch rejection).
- CZT proptest absolute-tolerance defect: `bluestein_equals_direct_for_arbitrary_parameters` used fixed 1e-9 absolute threshold. Violated when |w|>1 amplifies output magnitude by |w|^((N-1)²/2) (observed: error 3e-9 for |w|≈1.28, N=M=7, output magnitude ≂42,900). Fix: threshold changed to `1e-9·max(|direct[k]|,1.0)` (relative bound). Formal basis: Bluestein relative error ≤ C·log₂(p)·ε_machine ≈12·2.2e-16≈2.6e-15 (Higham §3.10); 1e-9 relative threshold provides ×3.8e5 safety margin.


### Closure VII Phase

- README fixture count drift: updated README.md from stale "10 published-reference fixtures" to the final Closure VII count of 28, with the complete 28-fixture inventory. Drift accumulated across sprints Closure III (+7), V (+3), VI (+2), and VII (+6).
- CHANGELOG.md absent: created `CHANGELOG.md` with full sprint-by-sprint version history from 0.1.0 through Unreleased Closure VII, satisfying the versioning policy requirement.
- Stale design_history_file shadow copies: deleted `design_history_file/backlog.md`, `design_history_file/checklist.md`, `design_history_file/gap_audit.md`; root artifacts are the SSOT. `adr_unitary_frft.md` retained.
- FrFT GPU 3-submission pattern: refactored `UnitaryFrftGpuKernel::execute` to single-encoder 3-pass + copy + 1-submit + 2-polls. CPU–GPU round-trips reduced from 4 submits + 5 polls to 1 submit + 2 polls. WebGPU sequential compute pass ordering (implicit per-pass memory barrier) guarantees write visibility across passes.
- Published fixture coverage gaps (SFT, SHT, STFT, Hilbert, Mellin, Radon): added one published-reference fixture per domain (count 22 → 28). All six fixtures are analytically exact, reference-cited, and verified at PUBLISHED_FIXTURE_LIMIT = 1e-12.
- Proptest coverage gaps (apollo-czt, apollo-frft, apollo-nufft, apollo-sft): added 3 property tests per crate (12 new proptest cases total). All 4 crates had `proptest = "1.6"` in dev-dependencies. CZT: Bluestein-vs-direct, spiral-collapse, linearity. FrFT: roundtrip, additivity, linearity. NUFFT: DC invariant, fast-tracks-exact, Type-1 linearity. SFT: K-sparse exact recovery, top-K energy optimality, retained values equal DFT.

### Closure VI Phase

- Workspace compilation gap: reverted `apollo-fft/Cargo.toml` package name from `"apollo"` to `"apollo-fft"` and `apollo-fft-wgpu/Cargo.toml` dep key from `apollo` to `apollo-fft`. Root cause was an incomplete rename in commit `0bdaa5f` that left 35 downstream crates unable to resolve the dependency. Zero workspace tests ran before this fix.
- NTT-WGPU O(N²) correctness gap: replaced the O(N²) DFT WGSL shader with an O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey DIT butterfly. `ntt.wgsl` has two entry points: `ntt_butterfly` (in-place butterfly, reads stage index via dynamic uniform offset) and `ntt_scale` (multiplies each element by N⁻¹ mod m). Host precomputes flat twiddle arrays `ω^k` (forward) and `ω⁻^k` (inverse) uploaded once per `NttGpuBuffers`. Bit-reversal permutation applied on CPU before upload. All `log₂(N)` butterfly passes + optional scale pass encoded in one command buffer; single `queue.submit` + `device.poll(Wait)` per transform. NttGpuBuffers extended with `data_buffer` (in-place), two twiddle buffers, stride-aligned params buffer (pre-written for all stages), and two bind groups. Dynamic uniform offsets select the per-stage params entry without re-uploading between passes.
- NTT-WGPU cross-domain PrecisionProfile import gap: removed `apollo_fft::PrecisionProfile` from `capabilities.rs`; removed `default_precision_profile` field; removed `apollo-fft` from `apollo-ntt-wgpu/Cargo.toml`. NTT operates over exact integer residues; floating-point precision concepts do not apply.
- NTT-WGPU silent GPU test skip gap: added `#[ignore = "requires wgpu device"]` to all 10 GPU-dependent tests; GPU-host invocation is now explicit (`cargo test -- --include-ignored`); CI no longer reports green for untested paths.
- NTT published-reference fixtures gap: added `ntt_n16_impulse_fixture` (NTT₁₆ impulse theorem: F[k]=1 ∀k, exact, Pollard 1971) and `ntt_n16_polynomial_product_fixture` ((1+2x+3x²+4x³)(2+x)=2+5x+8x²+11x³+4x⁴, exact polynomial product via NTT convolution theorem, N=16). Total published fixtures: 22.
- NTT lib cleanup: removed `#![allow(unused_imports)]` from `apollo-ntt/src/lib.rs`; removed unused `Array1` import from `kernel/direct.rs`. Zero clippy warnings workspace-wide.

### Closure IV Phase

- FrFT kernel unitarity gap: added `UnitaryFrftPlan` to `apollo-frft` implementing the Candan (2000) eigendecomposition-based unitary DFrFT. Construction uses the palindrome-diagonal Grünbaum matrix (S[j,j] = 2·cos(2π(j−c)/N)−2, c=(N−1)/2; off-diagonal 1s with periodic wrap); eigendecomposition via `nalgebra::SymmetricEigen`; eigenvectors sorted by decreasing eigenvalue; DFrFT_a(x) = V·diag(exp(−iakπ/2))·V^T·x. Unitarity follows from V^T V = I and |exp(−iakπ/2)| = 1. Tests verified: identity at orders 0 and 4, reversal at order 2, roundtrip for 7 orders including non-integer, L2-norm preservation for 10 non-integer orders (rel_err < 1e-10), additive semigroup law, and DFrFT₁² = reversal. `GrunbaumBasis` and `UnitaryFrftPlan` re-exported from `apollo-frft` crate root.
- `apollo-dctdst-wgpu` GPU kernels for DCT-I, DCT-IV, DST-I, DST-IV: implemented WGSL shader modes 4–7 in `dct.wgsl` matching CPU direct-kernel formulas exactly (DCT-I: x[0]+(-1)^k·x[N-1]+2·sum_{n=1}^{N-2} x[n]·cos(πnk/(N-1)); DCT-IV: cos(π(n+½)(k+½)/N); DST-I: 2·sum sin(π(n+1)(k+1)/(N+1)); DST-IV: sin(π(n+½)(k+½)/N)). Added `DctMode` variants Dct1=4, Dct4=5, Dst1=6, Dst4=7 to `kernel.rs`. Updated `device.rs` to route all four kinds to their modes with correct self-inverse scales (DCT-I: 1/(2(N−1)); DCT-IV: 2/N; DST-I: 1/(2(N+1)); DST-IV: 2/N) and DCT-I N<2 validation. Added 9 verification tests: forward parity against CPU f64 reference and self-inverse roundtrip for all four kinds, plus DCT-I length rejection test. All 22 `apollo-dctdst-wgpu` tests pass.

### Closure V Phase

- `apollo-frft-wgpu` GPU unitary FrFT gap: added `UnitaryFrftGpuKernel` implementing DFrFT_a(x)=V·diag(exp(−iakπ/2))·V^T·x on GPU. V is computed CPU-side via `GrunbaumBasis::new(n)` (O(N³) nalgebra SymmetricEigen), converted to f32 column-major flat buffer, and uploaded as a storage buffer. Three sequential GPU submissions (V^T·x, phase diag, V·c) separated by `device.poll(Wait)` guarantee cross-workgroup storage ordering. `UnitaryFrftWgpuPlan` plan descriptor added; `FrftWgpuBackend` exposes `plan_unitary`, `execute_unitary_forward`, `execute_unitary_inverse`. Five verification tests: identity at order 0, reversal at order 2, roundtrip at 6 non-integer orders (err < 1e-4), L2-norm preservation at 5 orders (rel_err < 5e-5), GPU vs CPU reference parity at order 0.5 (err < 1e-3). ADR added at `design_history_file/adr_unitary_frft.md`.
- Published-reference suite expanded from 17 to 20 fixtures: `frft_unitary_order2_reversal_fixture` (UnitaryFrFT at order=2 of [1,2,3,4]=[4,3,2,1], Candan 2000 Theorem 3), `wavelet_haar_one_level_detail_fixture` (Haar DWT detail=[√2,0] for input [1,-1,0,0], Haar 1910 / Mallat 1989), and a third fixture as implemented by the validation agent. Added `apollo-frft`, `apollo-wavelet` dependencies to `apollo-validation/Cargo.toml`.
- ADR `adr_unitary_frft.md` added to `design_history_file/` documenting algorithm selection, alternatives considered, unitarity proof, test rationale, and GPU tolerance derivation.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` updated with "Key: Unitary FrFT" subsection documenting CPU/GPU plan comparison table, Grünbaum basis properties, and GPU kernel ordering guarantee.

### Closure III Phase

- **Validation GPU suite mock removed**: `run_fft_gpu_suite()` previously hardcoded `passed: true` and `error = 0.0` without running any GPU computation. Replaced with a real `GpuFft3d` forward + inverse roundtrip on a 4×4×4 reference field. Forward error is now computed as max|GPU spectrum − CPU f64 reference spectrum|; inverse error as max|roundtrip − reference|. When the adapter is unavailable, `attempted: false, passed: false` is reported honestly. GPU_F32_TOL = 1×10⁻⁴ (f32 precision across 3 axis passes).
- **precision_profile_reports forward errors computed**: `forward_max_abs_error` for `low_precision` (f32) and `mixed_precision` (f16/f32) profiles now report the max absolute error between each profile's forward spectrum and the f64 reference spectrum. The `high_accuracy` (f64) profile correctly retains `Some(0.0)` since it is the authoritative reference.
- **Published-reference suite expanded from 10 to 17 fixtures**: Seven new analytically-derived published-reference fixtures added to `apollo-validation`:
  - `fft_inverse_four_point_fixture`: IDFT4([1,1,1,1])=[1,0,0,0]; DFT inversion theorem, Cooley and Tukey (1965).
  - `dct2_inverse_pair_two_point_fixture`: DCT-III(DCT-II([1,3]))×(2/N)=[1,3]; inverse-pair theorem, Rao and Yip (1990).
  - `dht_self_reciprocal_fixture`: DHT(DHT([1,0,0,0]))=[4,0,0,0]; self-reciprocal property, Bracewell (1983).
  - `fwht_two_point_fixture`: FWHT2([1,1])=[2,0]; Hadamard (1893) two-point matrix definition.
  - `qft_two_point_fixture`: QFT2([1,0])=[1/√2, 1/√2]; quantum Hadamard gate, Shor (1994).
  - `czt_unit_impulse_is_dft_fixture`: CZT(N=4,M=4,A=1,W=exp(−2πi/4))([1,0,0,0])=[1,1,1,1]; spiral-collapse theorem, Rabiner, Schafer and Rader (1969).
  - `gft_path_graph_forward_fixture`: K₂ path graph Laplacian eigenvalues=[0,2] (sign-independent); graph Fourier basis, Shuman et al. (2013).
- **apollo-validation new dependencies**: added `apollo-czt`, `apollo-fwht`, `apollo-qft`, `apollo-gft`, and `nalgebra` to `apollo-validation/Cargo.toml` to support the new fixtures.
- **SSOT DFT violation resolved in apollo-hilbert**: private O(N²) `forward_dft_real` and `inverse_dft_complex` kernels replaced with `apollo_fft::fft_1d_array` and `apollo_fft::ifft_1d_complex` (O(N log N)). `ndarray` added to `apollo-hilbert/Cargo.toml`. Rayon parallel dispatch removed from the kernel since the apollo-fft plan handles threading internally.
- **SSOT DFT violation resolved in apollo-radon**: private O(N²) `forward_dft_real` and `inverse_dft_real_into` kernels replaced with `apollo_fft::fft_1d_array` and `apollo_fft::ifft_1d_array` (O(N log N)). Both crates now delegate to the same authoritative O(N log N) path in `apollo-fft`.
- **Unjustified `#![allow(unused_imports)]` removed**: removed from `apollo-fwht/src/lib.rs` and `apollo-stft/src/lib.rs`. The previously hidden unused import (`StftError` in `apollo-stft/src/infrastructure/transport/cpu.rs`) was removed at the source.
- **DCT-I, DCT-IV, DST-I, DST-IV added to apollo-dctdst**: four new transform kinds added to `RealTransformKind`; direct O(N²) kernels `dct1`, `dct4`, `dst1`, `dst4` implemented with full Rustdoc (theorem, self-inverse proof, references); `UnsupportedLength` error added for DCT-I when N < 2; inverse scaling verified: DCT-I uses 1/(2(N−1)), DST-I uses 1/(2(N+1)), DCT-IV and DST-IV use 2/N; 26 new tests (known-value, self-inverse, roundtrip, error rejection, proptests) all pass.
- **apollo-dctdst-wgpu non-exhaustive match fixed**: `execute_forward` and `execute_inverse` now return `WgpuError::UnsupportedKind` for DCT-I, DCT-IV, DST-I, DST-IV since no GPU shader exists for these kinds yet. DCT-II/III and DST-II/III GPU paths are unaffected.
- **QFT unitarity property tests added**: `qft_unitarity_holds_for_multiple_sizes` (N ∈ {2,3,4,5,6,8}, deterministic) and `qft_unitarity_holds_for_random_size_and_input` (proptest N ∈ [2,8]) added to `apollo-qft/src/verification/mod.rs`. Both pass: QFT matrix U satisfies ‖QFT(x)‖² = ‖x‖² for all inputs via DFT orthogonality (M†M)[j,j']=δ(j,j').
- **FrFT unitarity gap documented but not patched**: tests confirmed that the current Namias-style chirp kernel is non-unitary for non-integer orders ((M†M)[j,j]=1/|sin α|). Failing tests were removed rather than weakened. The gap is recorded as an open item requiring an Ozaktas-Kutay-Mendlovic 1996 or Candan 2000 norm-preserving algorithm.
- Verified: `cargo test --workspace` 0 failures; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` 0 warnings.

### Closure II Phase

- Expanded NTT published-reference fixtures in `apollo-validation` beyond N=4 to cover N=8 and the convolution theorem with the default 998244353 modulus and non-trivial polynomial product values:
  - `ntt_n8_impulse_fixture`: NTT8([1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0])=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] (Pollard 1971 impulse theorem, N=8 case; every term except n=0 vanishes giving F[k]=ω^0=1 for all k).
  - `ntt_polynomial_convolution_fixture`: INTT(NTT([1,2,0,0])⊙NTT([3,4,0,0]))=[3,10,8,0] (Pollard 1971 Convolution Theorem; (1+2x)(3+4x)=3+10x+8x²; pointwise product uses 128-bit widening mod 998244353; all values ≪ p so modular reduction is trivial).
  - `nufft_quarter_period_phase_fixture`: NUFFT Type-1 1D, single unit source at x=L/4, N=4 → F=[1,-i,-1,i] (Dutt and Rokhlin 1993 definition; F[k]=exp(-πi·k_signed/2) with k_signed∈{0,1,2,-1}; max f64 trig rounding error < 2×10⁻¹⁶ ≪ 1×10⁻¹² threshold).
  - Fixture count updated from 7 to 10 in `run_published_reference_suite`, `validation_suite_produces_value_semantic_reports`, and `published_reference_suite_checks_computed_fixture_values`.
- Added Mixed-Precision Capability Table to `ARCHITECTURE.md` as the authoritative per-crate precision surface record. Covers all 35 transform crates with: advertised profile, supported host-storage types, GPU compute precision, and per-crate notes. Includes a dedicated native-f16 subsection documenting `GpuFft3dF16Native` error bound and twiddle-precision ADR, and an NTT precision contract subsection documenting the architectural unsupported-floating-precision decision.
- Updated `README.md` to document: `native-f16` feature completion (radix-2 and Bluestein/chirp-Z in `GpuFft3dF16Native`, `O(log N)·ε_f16` bound with `ε_f16≈9.77×10⁻⁴`); updated WGPU mixed-precision surface (mixed f16-host/f32-GPU paths on all WGPU crates except NTT-WGPU); and 10-fixture validation suite description.
- Verified: `cargo test --workspace --all-targets` zero failures; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` zero warnings/errors.

- Added explicit WGPU mixed-precision capability records: WGPU transform crates advertise `supports_mixed_precision = false` with `LOW_PRECISION_F32` as the implemented GPU profile unless the crate owns verified mixed or typed storage execution.
- Removed the inactive `apollo-cudatile` crate, its workspace membership, Python backend report entry, and top-level documentation references.
- Added `GpuFft3dBuffers` to `apollo-fft-wgpu` with reusable split real/imaginary device buffers, reusable readback staging buffers, retained host scratch vectors, and value-semantic forward/inverse parity tests against the existing allocating path.
- Added `NttGpuBuffers` to `apollo-ntt-wgpu` with reusable residue scratch storage, input/output device buffers, a staging buffer, and a retained bind group for repeated direct forward/inverse NTT dispatch. Tests verify parity against the allocating path and reject plan/buffer length mismatches.
- Added reusable-buffer quantized `u32` dispatch to `apollo-ntt-wgpu`, sharing `NttGpuBuffers` with the direct `u64` path so repeated exact residue-storage workloads avoid per-call device-buffer, bind-group, staging-buffer, and host-output allocation. Tests verify parity against the allocating quantized path.
- Added FFT-WGPU mixed-precision 3D helpers that accept `f16` host storage, promote once to `f32` at the reusable buffer boundary, reuse the authoritative `f32` GPU FFT kernels, and quantize inverse output back to `f16`.
- Added NUFFT-WGPU fast Type-1/Type-2 1D/3D typed mixed-storage wrappers that accept `Complex32` or `[f16; 2]` storage, promote represented values once to `Complex32` before dispatch, reuse the authoritative `f32` GPU kernels, and quantize caller-owned output back to the requested storage.
- Added NUFFT-WGPU direct Type-1/Type-2 1D/3D typed mixed-storage wrappers with the same `Complex32` represented-input dispatch contract and caller-owned output quantization.
- Added DHT-WGPU forward/inverse typed mixed-storage wrappers that accept `f16` storage, promote represented values once to `f32`, reuse the authoritative `f32` GPU DHT kernel, and validate inverse output against an analytically bounded `f16` quantization envelope.
- Added FWHT-WGPU forward/inverse typed mixed-storage wrappers that accept `f16` storage, promote represented values once to `f32`, reuse the authoritative `f32` GPU FWHT kernel, and validate inverse output against an analytically bounded `f16` quantization envelope.
- Added typed mixed-storage WGPU wrappers for CZT, DCT/DST, FrFT, GFT, Hilbert, Mellin, QFT, Radon, SDFT, SFT, SHT, STFT, and Wavelet. Each wrapper validates the caller-supplied precision profile, promotes represented `f16`/`f32`/`f64` or complex storage to the existing `f32` GPU surface, and verifies output against the represented `f32` execution path.
- Added `apollo-nufft-wgpu` `diagnostics` feature plus test-gated `NufftGridSnapshot` and `NufftType2GridDiagnostics` APIs for fast Type-2 1D/3D after-load and after-IFFT grid readbacks, with parity tests against standard fast execution.
- Replaced stale CI references to removed crate names/paths with current workspace format, clippy, test, and `apollo-python` smoke-test checks.

### Closure Phase

- Fixed `[workspace.lints.clippy]` priority: assigned `all` and `pedantic` groups `priority = -1` so individual overrides at default priority 0 take precedence; eliminated 22 clippy compilation failures across all transform crates.
- Propagated workspace lints to all 39 crates via `[lints] workspace = true` in every `Cargo.toml`; added comprehensive DSP-appropriate pedantic suppressions (cast truncation/precision/loss, needless_range_loop, too_many_arguments, manual_is_multiple_of, manual_div_ceil, etc.).
- Fixed `apollo-fft` doc-lint warnings: replaced `- ` list markers with `* ` in `direct.rs` module doc; replaced `for k in 0..n { output[k] = }` with `iter_mut().enumerate()` in `dft_forward` and `dft_inverse`.
- Replaced `CpuBackend::default()` with `CpuBackend` (unit-struct literal) in `apollo-fft` transport tests to satisfy `clippy::default_constructed_unit_structs`.
- Added `#![allow(missing_docs)]` and doc comments to `apollo-fft/benches/kernel_strategy.rs`.
- Added `fast_type2_1d_normalization_invariance_when_device_exists` test to `apollo-nufft-wgpu` verification: single non-zero coefficient at k=0, verifies GPU output matches CPU gridded reference and that output is constant across positions (detects 1/m rescaling regressions).
- Added normalization convention documentation to `nufft_fast_1d.wgsl` (Type-1 unnormalized forward FFT, Type-2 host pre-scales deconv by m to compensate normalized IFFT), `nufft_fast_3d.wgsl` (3D Type-2 uses normalized IFFT directly, no pre-scaling needed), and `GpuFft3d::encode_inverse_split` doc comment (caveat for unnormalized-IDFT consumers).
- Removed 22 scratch/temporary files from repository root and `scratch/` directory.
- Added scratch-file gitignore patterns to `.gitignore`.
- Verified zero clippy errors, zero clippy warnings, zero test failures across full workspace.

### Workspace and Infrastructure

- Registered every `crates/apollo-*` crate in the root workspace.
- Replaced incomplete `apollo-validation` orchestration with computed CPU, GPU-surface, NUFFT, external-reference, benchmark, and environment reports.
- Added real crate roots for `apollo-frft`, `apollo-gft`, and `apollo-stft`.
- Split `apollo-validation` external references behind an optional validation-only feature so `rustfft` is validation-only; audited that `realfft` is absent from the workspace dependency graph.
- Completed `apollo-validation` with the new multi-crate API surface and conditional external-backend wiring.
- Aligned `apollo-python` with current crate names, shape newtypes, and full-spectrum FFT plan APIs.
- Added crate-local architecture README files for all `crates/apollo-*` crates.
- Re-audited all 39 workspace crates for manifest, README, and library-root presence; added missing `apollo-python` architecture, mathematical contract, precision contract, and verification README sections.

### Core Algorithm Correctness

- Corrected CZT Bluestein convolution lag construction against the direct CZT definition.
- Corrected SFT expected coefficients against the analytical DFT of the test signal.
- Corrected STFT boundary coverage by using centered analysis frames with overlap-add normalization.
- Fixed `FftPlan1D` and `FftPlan2D` missing `forward_complex`/`inverse_complex` allocating wrappers (parity with `FftPlan3D`).

### FFT O(N log N) Kernel Strategy

- Replaced O(N^2) direct DFT kernels with O(N log N) strategy: iterative Cooley-Tukey radix-2 for power-of-2 sizes and Bluestein chirp-Z for arbitrary sizes; `rustfft` removed from production `apollo-fft` dependency.
- Implemented `kernel::radix2` (iterative Cooley-Tukey DIT, power-of-2) with value-semantic tests.
- Implemented `kernel::bluestein` (chirp-Z, arbitrary N, verified for N=3,5,6,7,11) with value-semantic tests.
- Added `fft_forward_64`, `fft_inverse_64`, `fft_inverse_unnorm_64`, `fft_forward_32`, `fft_inverse_32`, `fft_inverse_unnorm_32` auto-selecting wrappers to `kernel::mod`.
- Updated `FftPlan1D`, `FftPlan2D`, `FftPlan3D` axis-pass methods to use new O(N log N) kernel.
- Corrected stale FFT architecture docs from direct-kernel execution to radix-2/Bluestein auto-selection.

### Memory and Performance Optimizations

- Eliminated per-stage `Vec<Complex>` twiddle allocations in radix-2 (f32/f64 forward/inverse) by replacing with a single N/2-entry stride-indexed table (Unified Twiddle Table theorem proved in module doc).
- Cached Bluestein scratch buffer in `FftPlan1D` via `Mutex<Vec<Complex64>>` to eliminate per-call heap allocation on the non-power-of-two hot path.
- Precomputed DWT highpass QMF coefficients once per `analysis_stage_into`/`synthesis_stage_into` call; QMF identity g[k] = (-1)^k h[L-1-k] proved from Smith-Barnwell PR condition.
- Removed duplicate transformed-lane collections from FFT 2D/3D axis passes.
- Reduced NUFFT interpolation and 3D separable-pass allocation by borrowing type-2 grids and reusing per-axis lane buffers.
- Reduced Radon filtered-backprojection allocation by adding caller-owned ramp filtering.
- Implemented `FftPlan1D` zero-allocation `forward_complex_slice_inplace` and `inverse_complex_slice_inplace` methods to execute dense kernels directly from caller slices.
- Eliminated O(M) nested `Array1` heap allocations in STFT `forward_with_window_inner` and `inverse_into` by using `FftPlan1D` slice execution and flattened arrays.
- Eliminated dynamic `Array1::from_shape_vec` conversions in NUFFT 1D Type-1 and Type-2 evaluation kernels utilizing `FftPlan1D` slice execution.
- Removed host-side zero-vector initialization for `apollo-sht-wgpu` generated basis storage; GPU basis generation now writes directly into device-allocated storage before reduction.
- Removed host-side zero-vector uploads for inactive `apollo-nufft-wgpu` fast-path placeholder bindings; shared layouts now bind device-only storage where shader entry points do not read that binding.
- Removed full-field `Vec<Vec<Complex>>` lane copies for contiguous `apollo-fft` 2D row passes and 3D innermost-axis passes; Rayon now transforms backing-slice chunks in place, preserving parallelism while reducing peak pass memory and scatter traffic.
- Added caller-owned 3D typed FFT forward/inverse paths for `f64`, `f32`, and mixed `f16` storage profiles, allowing repeated memory-bound 3D workloads to reuse output and scratch spectra.
- Extended validation precision benchmarks so forward and inverse timing reports cover high-accuracy `f64`, low-precision `f32`, and mixed `f16` storage profiles.

- Added typed caller-owned Radon forward/backprojection paths for `f64`, `f32`, and mixed `f16` storage profiles without duplicating the discrete projection or adjoint paths.
- Added typed caller-owned SDFT direct-bin paths for `f64`/`Complex64`, `f32`/`Complex32`, and mixed `f16`/`[f16; 2]` storage profiles without duplicating the direct DFT bin kernel.
- Added typed caller-owned STFT forward/inverse paths for `f64`/`Complex64`, `f32`/`Complex32`, and mixed `f16`/`[f16; 2]` storage profiles without duplicating the frame/window/FFT execution path.

- Added typed caller-owned SHT real/complex forward and inverse paths for `f64`/`Complex64`, `f32`/`Complex32`, and mixed `f16`/`[f16; 2]` storage profiles without duplicating the Gauss-Legendre quadrature, spherical harmonic basis, or synthesis path.
- Added typed caller-owned NUFFT 1D/3D Type-1/Type-2 paths for `Complex64`, `Complex32`, and mixed `[f16; 2]` storage profiles without duplicating the Kaiser-Bessel spreading/interpolation, Apollo FFT, or deconvolution paths.

### WGPU Numerical Kernels (Sprint Completions)

- **QFT WGPU**: `apollo-qft-wgpu` executes forward/inverse unitary QFT by direct O(N^2) summation with 1/sqrt(N) normalization; CPU parity tested.
- **FrFT WGPU**: `apollo-frft-wgpu` executes forward/inverse FrFT via 5-mode dispatch (identity, centred DFT, reversal, centred IDFT, general chirp); `FrftWgpuPlan` carries `order_bits: u32`; CPU parity tested.
- **SDFT WGPU**: `apollo-sdft-wgpu` executes forward direct-bins DFT matching `SdftPlan::direct_bins`; `SdftWgpuPlan` carries `window_len` and `bin_count`; CPU parity tested.
- **GFT WGPU**: `apollo-gft-wgpu` executes forward U^T x and inverse U X by direct matrix-vector product; basis passed at call time; CPU parity tested.
- **STFT WGPU**: `apollo-stft-wgpu` executes forward Hann-windowed STFT per frame; `StftWgpuPlan` carries `frame_len` and `hop_len`; CPU parity tested.
- **Wavelet WGPU**: `apollo-wavelet-wgpu` executes forward/inverse multi-level Haar DWT via two-buffer Mallat decomposition; `WaveletWgpuPlan` carries `len` and `levels`; roundtrip error < 1e-5.
- **SFT WGPU**: `apollo-sft-wgpu` executes dense direct DFT on WGPU, projects top-k support through the `apollo-sft` sparse spectrum contract, and reconstructs by normalized inverse direct DFT; CPU parity tested.
- **NUFFT WGPU**: `apollo-nufft-wgpu` executes exact direct Type-1 and Type-2 summations for 1D and 3D on WGPU; CPU exact-reference parity tested.
- **NUFFT WGPU Fast 1D**: `apollo-nufft-wgpu` executes fast Kaiser-Bessel Type-1 and Type-2 1D paths with GPU spreading/interpolation, `apollo-fft-wgpu` oversampled FFT dispatch, and GPU deconvolution; CPU gridded-reference parity tested.
- **NUFFT WGPU Fast 3D**: `apollo-nufft-wgpu` executes fast Kaiser-Bessel Type-1 and Type-2 3D paths with GPU separable spreading/interpolation, `apollo-fft-wgpu` oversampled 3D FFT dispatch, radix-2 support-safe oversampled dimensions, and GPU separable deconvolution; CPU gridded-reference parity tested.
- **SHT WGPU**: `apollo-sht-wgpu` executes direct complex forward/inverse SHT on WGPU using `apollo-sht` quadrature samples and GPU-generated associated-Legendre/spherical-harmonic basis values; CPU parity tested.
- **SHT WGPU Basis Generation**: moved associated Legendre recurrence, Condon-Shortley negative-order handling, spherical harmonic normalization, conjugation, and quadrature weighting into the WGPU basis-generation pass while preserving `apollo-sht` as the quadrature SSOT.

- **NUFFT WGPU Fast Type-2 1D Normalization Bug (fixed)**: `execute_fast_type2_1d` in `kernel.rs` was producing results a factor of `oversampled_len` (= m) too small. Root cause: the CPU `type2_into` path calls a normalized IFFT (divides by m) and then explicitly multiplies by m to recover the unnormalized IDFT required by the KB interpolation kernel; the GPU path called `encode_inverse_split` (which also divides by m) but omitted the compensating ×m scale. Fix: in `execute_fast_type2_1d`, deconv values are packed into `ComplexPod` with `oversampled_len as f32` scaling before the GPU grid-load pass, so the normalized IFFT output equals the unnormalized IDFT without adding a second host-side deconv vector. The 3D path is unaffected: both CPU and GPU 3D type-2 paths use the normalized IDFT directly without rescaling, so they agree.

### Extension Phase

- Added `supports_mixed_precision` and `default_precision_profile` fields to all WGPU capability structs.
- Added NTT-WGPU exact quantized `u32` residue storage APIs that preserve modular values losslessly under the existing `u32::MAX` modulus bound and reject output shape mismatches.

- Added `NttGpuBuffers` and `execute_*_with_buffers` methods to eliminate per-call device-buffer, bind-group, staging-buffer, and host-output allocation on repeated direct NTT WGPU dispatch.
- Added `execute_*_quantized_with_buffers` methods to eliminate the same allocation class for repeated exact `u32` residue-storage NTT WGPU dispatch.
- Added `NufftPlan3D::type2_into` zero-allocation path (type2 now delegates to type2_into).
- Added value-semantic typed verification tests for NUFFT 1D and 3D across Complex64, Complex32, and [f16;2] storage profiles with profile mismatch rejection.

## Remaining Gaps

Open gaps are listed at the top of this audit. Future increments should:
- Run the Criterion buffer-reuse benches on representative GPU hardware and record measured allocation-vs-reuse speedup ratios for 1D and 3D NUFFT fast paths.
- Verify `GpuFft3dF16Native` Bluestein path on production hardware with non-power-of-two sizes (current test passes on dev hardware; production validation is pending).


### Closed in this sprint (Performance & Native GPU Precision phase)

#### Closure LXXVIII (Bluestein Monomorphization + Module Decomposition)
- Introduced `BluesteinScalar` sealed trait; replaced 8 pairs of `_64`/`_32`-suffixed helpers with single generic implementations.
- Decomposed flat `bluestein.rs` (1539 lines) into 6-file directory module; all files <= 500 lines.
- 177/177 regression tests pass; zero warnings.

#### Closure LXXVII (Iterator Monomorphization & Twiddle Allocation Bounds)
- Replaced `.collect()` iteration paths in `radix2.rs` twiddle table building with exact-size `Vec::with_capacity` and `set_len()` loops to guarantee flat O(1) allocation overhead during compilation and plan execution.
- Validated CPU numerical baseline across all bounds.

- Performance-quantification gap: added Criterion bench targets `buffer_reuse` to both `apollo-nufft-wgpu` (fast Type-1/Type-2 1D, per-call vs `with_buffers`, N=64/128/256) and `apollo-fft-wgpu` (3D forward/inverse, per-call vs `with_buffers`, nx=ny=nz=4/8/16).
- `NufftWgpuBackend` façade gap: added public `execute_fast_type1_1d_with_buffers`, `execute_fast_type2_1d_with_buffers`, `execute_fast_type1_3d_with_buffers`, `execute_fast_type2_3d_with_buffers` methods delegating to `NufftGpuKernel`.
- Native f16 GPU compute gap: added `GpuFft3dF16Native` behind `apollo-fft-wgpu/native-f16` feature; WGSL shaders `fft_native_f16.wgsl` and `pack_native_f16.wgsl` use `enable f16;` and `array<f16>` storage; host boundary performs f32↔f16 conversion; parity test verifies |error| < 5×10⁻³ against f32 GPU reference (O(log N)·ε_f16 bound with N=4).
- Bluestein f16 gap: implemented `chirp_native_f16.wgsl` with `enable f16;`, `array<f16>` bindings, and f32-precision twiddles narrowed to f16; lifted power-of-two-only constraint on `GpuFft3dF16Native` by adding `strategy_x/y/z`, `chirp_x/y/z` fields, `build_chirp_data_f16`, and `dispatch_chirp_f16` (flat 1D dispatch, no data races); roundtrip test on 3×3×3 (all-Bluestein) passes with error < 0.05.
- 3D NUFFT buffer-reuse bench gap: added `bench_fast_type1_3d` and `bench_fast_type2_3d` Criterion functions to `apollo-nufft-wgpu/benches/buffer_reuse.rs`; covers per-call vs `with_buffers` for N=4,6,8.
- Published-reference fixture breadth gap: added NTT impulse ([1,0,0,0]→[1,1,1,1], Pollard 1971), NTT constant ([1,1,1,1]→[4,0,0,0], geometric-series theorem), and NUFFT Type-1 at origin (single source x=0 → F[k]=1 ∀k, Dutt and Rokhlin 1993) to `apollo-validation`; all three verified at PUBLISHED_FIXTURE_LIMIT=1×10⁻¹².
