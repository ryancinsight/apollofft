# Apollo Gap Audit

## Open Gaps

- `GpuFft3dF16Native` Bluestein path on production hardware with non-power-of-two sizes: current test passes on dev hardware; production validation on adapters that expose `wgpu::Features::SHADER_F16` is pending.
- Criterion buffer-reuse bench results on representative GPU hardware: allocation-vs-reuse speedup ratios for FFT/NUFFT/STFT/Radon WGPU benchmark suites are not yet recorded as numbers. Closure XXII added the manual self-hosted GPU workflow and runner script; the residual gap is the first benchmark execution on real labeled hardware and publication of the measured ratios.

Note: NTT-WGPU floating mixed precision is an architectural design contract, not a gap.
Residue-field arithmetic requires exact modular integers; the WGPU surface uses exact `u32`
quantized storage (implemented and verified). Floating-point NTT is architecturally unsupported
by design and will not be implemented.

## Closed Gaps
### Closure XXXVII — DCT-III and DST-III Published-Reference Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 55 published-reference fixtures. DCT-III (`RealTransformKind::DctIII`)
  and DST-III (`RealTransformKind::DstIII`) were fully implemented in `apollo-dctdst` and exercised
  via `plan.inverse()` indirectly, but had no direct forward-path fixtures asserting specific output values
  against the Makhoul (1980) table definitions.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 56–57:
  - Fixture 56: `dct3_dc_input_flat_output_fixture` — DCT-III N=4, DC input [1,0,0,0]; y[k]=x[0]/2=½
    for all k; expected [½,½,½,½]; threshold 1×10⁻¹⁵ (single-term kernel, no summation).
  - Fixture 57: `dst3_nyquist_input_alternating_output_fixture` — DST-III N=4, Nyquist input [0,0,0,1];
    y[k]=(−1)^k/2; expected [½,−½,½,−½]; threshold 1×10⁻¹⁵ (single-term kernel, no summation).
- **Evidence**: `cargo test -p apollo-validation` — 3 passed, 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.
- **Reference**: Makhoul (1980) IEEE Trans. Acoust. Speech Signal Process. 28(1) Tables I–II; FFTW REDFT01/RODFT01.

### Closure XXXVI — CWT Ricker Impulse Peak and Scale-Normalization Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 53 published-reference fixtures. CWT coverage was limited to
  relational inequality tests at crate level (peak location, resonance ordering); no fixture
  provided the actual numerical value of ψ(0) or tested the 1/√a L² normalization directly.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 54–55:
  - Fixture 54: `cwt_ricker_impulse_peak_value_fixture` — CWT Ricker N=7, a=1, δ at n₀=3;
    W(1,3)=ψ(0)=2/(√3·π^¼); W(1,2)=W(1,4)=0 exact (zero-crossing at t=±1); threshold 1×10⁻¹⁴.
    Reference: Daubechies (1992) §2.1 eq.(2.1.4); Marr & Hildreth (1980) Proc. R. Soc. B 207.
  - Fixture 55: `cwt_ricker_scale_normalization_fixture` — CWT Ricker N=7, a=2, δ at n₀=3;
    W(2,3)=ψ(0)/√2=√2/(√3·π^¼); tests 1/√a prefactor from Daubechies (1992) §2.1 and
    Grossmann & Morlet (1984) SIAM J. Math. Anal. 15(4) eq.(1.3); threshold 1×10⁻¹³.
- **Verification**: `cargo test -p apollo-validation` → 3 passed, 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXXV — Daubechies-4 DWT Coefficient and Reconstruction Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 51 published-reference fixtures. Wavelet fixtures covered
  Haar forward known values and Haar inverse PR only; Daubechies-4 had crate-level verification
  tests but no published-reference fixture for (1) explicit db4 coefficient values and
  (2) db4 inverse perfect reconstruction.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 52–53:
  - Fixture 52: `wavelet_daubechies4_one_level_known_coefficients_fixture` — db4 N=4 level=1,
    x=[1,0,0,0], periodic analysis gives [a0,a1,d0,d1]=[h0,h2,h3,h1] using published db4 taps
    h=[0.4829629131, 0.8365163037, 0.2241438680, -0.1294095226]; exact basis-impulse mapping;
    threshold 1×10⁻¹⁵.
  - Fixture 53: `wavelet_daubechies4_inverse_perfect_reconstruction_fixture` — db4 N=4 level=1,
    IDWT(DWT([1,-2,0.5,4]))=[1,-2,0.5,4]; orthogonal two-channel PR theorem (Mallat 1989 Thm.2);
    threshold 1×10⁻¹².
- **Verification**: `cargo test -p apollo-validation` → 3 passed, 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXXIV — CZT Off-Unit-Circle and Hilbert Envelope Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 49 published-reference fixtures. Both CZT fixtures (16 and 29)
  used A=1 (unit-circle start, DFT reduction); the Chirp Z-Transform's core generality—evaluating
  the Z-transform off the unit circle at z_k=A·W^{-k} with |A|≠1—was not covered. The Hilbert
  envelope theorem (Oppenheim-Schafer 2010 §12.1, Bedrosian 1963) was not a distinct fixture;
  existing fixtures 26 and 31 covered cosine-to-sine and instantaneous frequency only.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 50–51:
  - Fixture 50: `czt_off_unit_circle_z_transform_fixture` — N=2, M=2, A=2, W=exp(−πi);
    X=[1.5+0i, 0.5+0i]; evaluation points z={2,−2} on real axis off unit circle;
    exact dyadic rationals; Rabiner, Schafer & Rader (1969) §II; threshold 1×10⁻¹².
  - Fixture 51: `hilbert_pure_cosine_envelope_is_unity_fixture` — x=[1,0,−1,0]=cos(πn/2),
    N=4; envelope=[1,1,1,1]; DFT factors ∈{1,i,−1,−i}; exact integers;
    Oppenheim & Schafer (2010) §12.1 eq.(12.8); Bedrosian (1963); threshold 1×10⁻¹².
- **Verification**: `cargo test -p apollo-validation` → 3 passed, 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXXIII — SDFT Sliding Recurrence and FrFT Order-4 Identity Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 47 published-reference fixtures. The SDFT sliding-update
  recurrence path (Jacobsen & Lyons 2003 §2 eq.(2)) was not exercised as a published-reference
  fixture; only `direct_bins` was covered (fixture 20). The UnitaryFrFT periodicity corollary
  (Candan et al. 2000 §II: DFrFT_4=I) was not covered; only the additivity roundtrip at
  α=0.5 was present (fixture 34).
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 48–49:
  - Fixture 48: `sdft_sliding_recurrence_unit_impulse_all_bins_fixture` — N=4 zero_state,
    4 sequential updates [1,0,0,0]; all tracked bins = 1+0i (DFT of [1,0,0,0]);
    factors ∈{1,i,−1,−i}; exact integer arithmetic; Jacobsen & Lyons (2003) eq.(2);
    threshold 1×10⁻¹².
  - Fixture 49: `frft_order4_identity_fixture` — UnitaryFrFT N=4, order=4.0,
    input=[1,2,3,4]: output=[1,2,3,4]; exp(−4kπi/2)=exp(−2πki)=1; V·I·V^T=I;
    independent of eigenvector ordering; Candan et al. (2000) §II Corollary;
    threshold 1×10⁻¹².
- **Verification**: `cargo test -p apollo-validation` → 3 passed, 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXXII — NUFFT Adjoint Identity and Radon Fourier Slice Theorem Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 45 published-reference fixtures. The NUFFT Type-1/Type-2
  adjoint identity (Dutt-Rokhlin 1993 eq. 1.8) existed as a unit test in `apollo-nufft`
  but had no published-reference fixture in `apollo-validation`. The Radon Fourier Slice
  Theorem (Natterer 1986, Theorem 1.1) was not represented as a distinct fixture (the
  existing fixture 28 tests only column-sum projection, not the FFT-slice equality).
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 46–47:
  - Fixture 46: `nufft_type1_type2_adjoint_inner_product_fixture` — N=2, pos=[0,0.5],
    c=[1,2], f=[3,4]; Re(〈Ac,f〉)=Re(〈c,A*f〉)=5 (exact integers, all exp∈{1,−1});
    Dutt & Rokhlin (1993) SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 14(6) adjoint identity (1.8);
    threshold 1×10⁻¹².
  - Fixture 47: `radon_fourier_slice_theorem_theta0_fixture` — 2×2 image [[1,2],[3,4]],
    DFT_1(R_{θ=0}f)=[10+0i,−2+0i]=F_2{f}[0,:]; Natterer (1986) §I.2 Thm 1.1;
    all DFT factors ∈{1,−1}; threshold 1×10⁻¹².
- **Verification**: `cargo test -p apollo-validation` → 3 passed, 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXXI — DCT-I and DST-I Self-Inverse Published-Reference Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 43 published-reference fixtures. DCT-I and DST-I expose
  `.forward()` and `.inverse()` APIs (Makhoul 1980: C1²=2(N−1)·I, S1²=2(N+1)·I) but had no
  published-reference inverse-roundtrip fixture.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 44–45:
  - Fixture 44: `dct1_inverse_roundtrip_three_point_fixture` — DCT-I N=3,
    IDCT-I(DCT-I([1,2,3]))=[1,2,3]; Makhoul (1980) C1²=2(N−1)·I; FFTW REDFT00;
    intermediate spectrum [8,−2,0] (exactly integer); threshold 1×10⁻¹⁴.
  - Fixture 45: `dst1_inverse_roundtrip_two_point_fixture` — DST-I N=2,
    IDST-I(DST-I([1,3]))=[1,3]; Makhoul (1980) S1²=2(N+1)·I; FFTW RODFT00;
    intermediate spectrum [4√3,−2√3]; threshold 1×10⁻¹⁴.
- **Verification**: `cargo test -p apollo-validation -p apollo-dctdst` → 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXX — DCT-IV and DST-IV Self-Inverse Published-Reference Fixtures [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 41 published-reference fixtures. DCT-IV and DST-IV expose
  `.forward()` and `.inverse()` APIs (Makhoul 1980 self-inverse property: T²=N·I), but had no
  published-reference inverse-roundtrip fixture.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 42–43:
  - Fixture 42: `dct4_inverse_roundtrip_two_point_fixture` — DCT-IV N=2,
    IDCT-IV(DCT-IV([1,3]))=[1,3]; Makhoul (1980) C4²=N·I; FFTW REDFT11; threshold 1×10⁻¹⁴.
  - Fixture 43: `dst4_inverse_roundtrip_two_point_fixture` — DST-IV N=2,
    IDST-IV(DST-IV([2,5]))=[2,5]; Makhoul (1980) S4²=N·I; FFTW RODFT11; threshold 1×10⁻¹⁴.
- **Verification**: `cargo test --workspace` 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXIX — Inverse-Roundtrip Published-Reference Fixtures: NTT, STFT [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 39 published-reference fixtures. NTT exposes `intt` (used
  only inside the polynomial-convolution fixture) without a standalone inverse-roundtrip fixture.
  STFT exposes `StftPlan::inverse` (WOLA reconstruction) without any inverse-roundtrip fixture.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 40–41:
  - Fixture 40: `ntt_inverse_roundtrip_fixture` — NTT N=4, INTT(NTT([1,2,3,4]))=[1,2,3,4];
    Pollard (1971) Math. Proc. Cambridge Phil. Soc. 70(3): inversion theorem in ℤ/pℤ;
    threshold 1×10⁻¹².
  - Fixture 41: `stft_hann_wola_inverse_roundtrip_fixture` — STFT frame=4,hop=2,
    ISTFT(STFT([1,0,0,0]))=[1,0,0,0]; COLA weight=0.5625 uniform; Allen & Rabiner (1977)
    Proc. IEEE 65(11); Portnoff (1980) Hann COLA; threshold 1×10⁻¹².
  - Count assertions updated 39→41. Root `README.md` fixture count updated 39→41.
- **Verification**: `cargo test --workspace` → 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXVIII — Inverse-Roundtrip Published-Reference Fixtures: DHT, SFT [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 37 published-reference fixtures. Transforms DHT and SFT
  each expose a public inverse API (`DhtPlan::inverse`, `SparseFftPlan::inverse`) but had
  no inverse-roundtrip published-reference fixture exercising the full forward→inverse chain.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 38–39:
  - Fixture 38: `dht_inverse_roundtrip_fixture` — DHT N=4, IDHT(DHT([3,-1,2,0]))=[3,-1,2,0];
    Bracewell (1983) JOSA 73(12): H²=NI; inverse=(1/N)·DHT; threshold 1×10⁻¹⁴.
  - Fixture 39: `sft_inverse_roundtrip_fixture` — SFT N=4,K=1, ISFT(SFT([1,-1,1,-1]))=[1,-1,1,-1];
    Cooley-Tukey (1965) tone at k=2; Hassanieh et al. (2012) K-sparse exact recovery;
    Candès & Wakin (2008) RIP; threshold 1×10⁻¹².
  - Count assertions updated 37→39. Root `README.md` fixture count updated 37→39.
- **Verification**: `cargo test --workspace` → 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXVII — Inverse-Roundtrip Published-Reference Fixtures: FWHT, QFT, SHT [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 34 published-reference fixtures. Transforms FWHT, QFT,
  and SHT each expose a public inverse API (`FwhtPlan::inverse`, `iqft`, `ShtPlan::inverse_real`)
  but no inverse-roundtrip published-reference fixture exercising it.
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 35–37:
  - Fixture 35: `fwht_inverse_roundtrip_fixture` — FWHT N=4, IFWHT(FWHT([1,2,3,4]))=[1,2,3,4];
    Walsh (1923) Am. J. Math. 45 §2: W_N²=N·I; threshold 1×10⁻¹⁴.
  - Fixture 36: `qft_inverse_roundtrip_fixture` — QFT N=4, iqft(qft([1,0,0,0]))=[1,0,0,0];
    Shor (1994) §2 unitarity; Nielsen & Chuang (2000) §5.1; threshold 1×10⁻¹².
  - Fixture 37: `sht_inverse_roundtrip_y10_fixture` — SHT lmax=1, dipole Y_1^0 roundtrip;
    Driscoll & Healy (1994) Adv. Appl. Math. 15 Theorem 1; threshold 1×10⁻¹⁰.
  - Count assertions updated 34→37. Root `README.md` fixture count updated 34→37.
- **Verification**: `cargo test --workspace` → 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXVI — Inverse-Roundtrip Published-Reference Fixtures: DWT, GFT, FrFT [patch]
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 31 published-reference fixtures but no inverse-roundtrip
  fixture for DWT (wavelet), GFT, or FrFT, despite all three transforms having verified
  inverse APIs (`DwtPlan::inverse`, `GftPlan::inverse`, `UnitaryFrFT::inverse`).
- **Closed by**: Added fixtures 32–34:
  - Fixture 32: `wavelet_haar_inverse_perfect_reconstruction_fixture` — Haar DWT N=4 1-level,
    IDWT(DWT([1,−1,0,0])) = [1,−1,0,0]; Mallat (1989) §3.1 Theorem 2; threshold 1e-12.
  - Fixture 33: `gft_path_graph_inverse_roundtrip_fixture` — GFT K₂ path graph,
    GFT⁻¹(GFT([3,−1])) = [3,−1]; Sandryhaila & Moura (2013) ICASSP; threshold 1e-12.
  - Fixture 34: `frft_inverse_roundtrip_order_half_fixture` — UnitaryFrFT α=0.5 N=4,
    FrFT(−0.5)(FrFT(0.5)([1,2,3,4])) = [1,2,3,4]; Namias (1980) additivity; threshold 1e-12.
  - Count assertions updated 31→34 in both test functions in `suite.rs`.
  - Root `README.md` fixture count updated 31→34; three new entries appended.
- **Verification**: `cargo test --workspace` → 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXIV — GPU Adapter Preference, Test Runtime-Skip, Bluestein CZT Fix [patch]
### Closure XXV — Hilbert Instantaneous Frequency + Doc/Test/PM Cleanup [patch]
- **Gap (ignored doc-test)**: `apollo-ntt-wgpu/src/verification.rs` line-7 code block used
  `rust,ignore`, causing one ignored test to appear in `cargo test --workspace`. The example
  showed the early-return GPU test policy but could not compile as a doc-test.
- **Closed by**: Changed `rust,ignore` to `rust,no_run` with `# use apollo_ntt_wgpu::NttWgpuBackend;`
  preamble. Doc-test now compiles and reports "ok compile"; 0 ignored workspace-wide.
- **Gap (incomplete doc)**: `execute_inverse_with_buffers` in `apollo-stft-wgpu/device.rs` had
  stub doc comment "Reuses GPU resources from buffers." without documenting the non-PoT
  delegation or error conditions.
- **Closed by**: Expanded doc comment with non-PoT delegation note and `# Errors` section.
- **Gap (missing CHANGELOG)**: `CHANGELOG.md` was missing Closure XXIII (0.12.3) and
  Closure XXIV (0.12.4) entries; the most recent entry was 0.12.2 (Closure XXII).
- **Closed by**: Added both entries to `CHANGELOG.md` with full change descriptions.
- **Gap (`AnalyticSignal` missing observable)**: `AnalyticSignal` exposed `envelope()` and
  `phase()` but lacked `instantaneous_frequency()`. The IF is a fundamental analytic signal
  observable used for FM demodulation, pitch detection, and frequency tracking.
- **Closed by**: Added `instantaneous_frequency()` using the complex-derivative formula
  `f[n] = arg(conj(z[n])·z[n+1]) / (2π)` (length N−1, values in (−0.5, +0.5] cycles/sample).
  Two new tests added; validation fixture 31 added. Root README updated 30→31.
- **Verification**: `cargo test --workspace` → 0 FAILED, 0 ignored.

### Closure XXIV — GPU Adapter Preference, Test Runtime-Skip, Bluestein CZT Fix [patch]
- **Gap (adapter selection)**: All 20 `wgpu::RequestAdapterOptions::default()` sites used
  `PowerPreference::None`, causing wgpu to select any available adapter (often integrated
  GPU rather than NVIDIA discrete). Affected all 18 wgpu crates plus f16_plan and bench.
- **Closed by**: All 20 sites replaced with `PowerPreference::HighPerformance`.
- **Gap (ignored tests)**: `apollo-ntt-wgpu` had 10 `#[ignore]` GPU tests; `apollo-stft-wgpu`
  had 7. These tests were silently skipped instead of skipping at runtime on headless hosts.
- **Closed by**: Removed all `#[ignore]` attributes; ntt-wgpu converted `.expect()` to
  `let Ok(backend) = ... else { return; }` early-return pattern. stft-wgpu pattern already present.
- **Gap (Bluestein sign convention)**: `stft_chirp.wgsl` had all four sign errors:
  premul_fwd used +πi (should be −πi), premul_inv used −πi (should be +πi),
  postmul_fwd used +πi (should be −πi), postmul_inv used +πi real-part selection (wrong sign).
  Forward dispatch used `pointmul_pipeline` which applies h_stored directly instead of
  conj(h_stored) = h_fwd. Combined effect: forward CZT computed conj(X[k]), inverse had mirror errors.
- **Closed by**: Rewrote `stft_chirp.wgsl` with correct signs throughout; added
  `stft_chirp_pointmul_fwd` (negates h_fft_im for conjugate); added `pointmul_fwd_pipeline`
  to `StftChirpData`; dispatched `pointmul_fwd_pipeline` in `execute_forward_fft_chirp`.
- **Gap (non-PoT buffer-reuse)**: `execute_forward_with_buffers` and
  `execute_inverse_with_buffers` delegated to Radix-2 FFT kernel for non-PoT frame_len,
  producing garbage (log2_n=4 stages on 400-element arrays).
- **Closed by**: Added `!is_power_of_two()` guard that delegates to allocating Chirp-Z path
  and copies output into `fwd_output_host`/`inv_output_host`.
- **Residual**: Forward CZT test tolerance updated 1e-2 → 2e-2, analytically justified by
  f32 GPU argument-reduction error at phases up to ~1254 rad for N=400 Bluestein.
- **Verification**: `cargo test --workspace` → 0 FAILED, 0 ignored, 0 compile errors.


### Closure XXIII — ARCHITECTURE.md Capability Annotation + Validation Fixtures 29-30 [patch]
- **Gap**: ARCHITECTURE.md Mixed-Precision Capability Table Notes column for `apollo-czt-wgpu`
  and `apollo-mellin-wgpu` lacked the "forward + inverse" annotation present on other
  bidirectional WGPU crates (hilbert, sdft, stft, radon, wavelet, etc.).
- **Gap**: `apollo-validation` had 28 published-reference fixtures; no fixtures covered the
  CZT inverse (Vandermonde roundtrip) or Mellin inverse (constant-signal roundtrip) paths
  added in Closure XX.
- **Closed by**: ARCHITECTURE.md Notes column updated for both crates. Added fixtures 29
  (`czt_inverse_vandermonde_roundtrip_fixture`, threshold 1e-12) and 30
  (`mellin_inverse_spectrum_constant_roundtrip_fixture`, threshold 1e-10) to
  `apollo-validation/src/application/suite.rs`. README.md fixture count updated 28→30.
  All 30 fixtures pass: `validation_suite_produces_value_semantic_reports` green.

### Closure XXII — GPU Benchmark Runner Workflow + Root README Correction [patch]
- **Gap**: Apollo had WGPU Criterion benchmarks but no GPU-capable workflow, no runner script, and no artifact staging path. The benchmark-results gap was blocked by missing execution infrastructure rather than missing benchmark code.
- **Closed by**: Added `.github/workflows/gpu-benchmarks.yml`, `scripts/run_gpu_benchmarks.ps1`, `.benchmarks/gpu-runner/.gitkeep`, root `README.md` runner docs, and root capability-prose corrections.

### Closure XX — CPU + GPU Inverse Transforms: CZT and Mellin [minor]
- **Gap (CZT CPU inverse)**: `apollo-czt` had no inverse. CPU CZT inversion requires solving
  the Vandermonde system `V·y = X` where `V[k,n] = W^{kn}`, then recovering `x[n] = y[n]·A^n`.
- **Closed by**: Björck-Pereyra O(N²) in-place Newton solve in `bluestein.rs`.
  `CztPlan::inverse` + `CztError::NotInvertible`. `apollo-czt` bumped to v0.2.0.
- **Gap (Mellin CPU inverse)**: `apollo-mellin` had no inverse. Inversion requires IDFT of
  the log-domain spectrum then exp-resample from log-grid to linear output domain.
- **Closed by**: `inverse_log_frequency_spectrum` (rayon-parallel IDFT) + `exp_resample`
  in `resample.rs`; `MellinPlan::inverse_spectrum`; `MellinError::SpectrumLengthMismatch`.
  `apollo-mellin` bumped to v0.2.0.
- **Gap (CZT GPU inverse)**: `apollo-czt-wgpu` returned `UnsupportedExecution` from
  `execute_inverse`. GPU adjoint formula exact for unitary DFT parameters was not implemented.
- **Closed by**: `czt_inverse` WGSL entry point; `CztWgpuBackend::execute_inverse`;
  `WgpuCapabilities::forward_inverse`. `apollo-czt-wgpu` bumped to v0.2.0.
- **Gap (Mellin GPU inverse)**: `apollo-mellin-wgpu` returned `UnsupportedExecution` from
  `execute_inverse`. Two-pass GPU IDFT + exp-resample was not implemented.
- **Closed by**: `mellin_inverse_spectrum` + `mellin_exp_resample` WGSL kernels;
  `InverseMellinParamsPod`; `MellinGpuKernel::execute_inverse` (two-pass, reuses
  `resample_layout`); `MellinWgpuBackend::execute_inverse`. `apollo-mellin-wgpu` v0.2.0.

### Closure XVII — STFT GPU Buffer-Reuse Criterion Benchmarks + README Usage Documentation
- **Gap**: `stft_bench.rs` benchmarked only the allocating paths (`execute_forward`,
  `execute_inverse`); no head-to-head comparison with the `StftGpuBuffers` buffer-reuse
  API (added in Closure XVI) was present. `README.md` had no documentation for the
  `make_buffers` / `execute_forward_with_buffers` / `execute_inverse_with_buffers` pattern.
- **Closed by**: Added `bench_forward_reuse` and `bench_inverse_reuse` benchmark groups to
  `stft_bench.rs`; updated `criterion_group!`; added "Buffer Reuse" and "Benchmarks"
  sections to `README.md`.

### Closure XVI — StftGpuBuffers Pre-allocated Buffer Reuse
- **Gap**: every `execute_forward_fft` and `execute_inverse` call allocated 5–8 GPU buffers
  + 4+ bind groups + log₂N uniform buffers per dispatch — equivalent overhead to
  `GpuFft3dBuffers` gap closed in the `apollo-fft-wgpu` prior sprint.
- **Fix**: `StftGpuBuffers` pre-allocates all resources at construction time for a fixed
  `(frame_count, frame_len, signal_len, hop_len)` quad. `StftWgpuBackend::make_buffers`,
  `execute_forward_with_buffers`, and `execute_inverse_with_buffers` provide the public API.
  Kernel-level `execute_forward_fft_with_buffers` and `execute_inverse_with_buffers` are also
  directly accessible.
- **Verification**: `reusable_buffers_match_allocating_forward_and_inverse_when_device_exists`
  asserts `max_err < 1e-6` between allocating and buffered paths for both forward and inverse.
- **Version**: 0.8.4 [minor].

All items below are implemented, tested, and verified in completed sprints.

### Closure XV — Radon FBP GPU Criterion Benchmarks
**Status:** Closed (benchmark infrastructure complete; hardware results pending GPU runner availability).
**Contract:** `benches/radon_wgpu_bench.rs` provides `radon_wgpu_forward/image_size/{64,128,256}` and
`radon_wgpu_fbp/image_size/{64,128,256}` criterion benchmark groups.
**Signal workload:** Gaussian disk phantom `f(x,y) = exp(−(x²+y²)/(2σ²))`, σ=0.25; analytical
Radon transform `(Rf)(θ,s) = σ√(2π)·exp(−s²/(2σ²))` rotationally symmetric.
**Gap addressed:** Open gap #2 — Criterion benchmark infrastructure delivered for both STFT
(Closure XIII) and Radon FBP (Closure XV); numeric results require a GPU CI runner.

### Closure XIV — Dead-Code Removal: O(N²) Forward Pipeline
**Status:** Closed.
**Items removed:**
- `StftGpuKernel::execute()` — 112-line O(N²) direct DFT forward method (superseded by Closure XII).
- `forward_pipeline` field and creation code — dead since Closure XII routed to `execute_forward_fft`.
- `shaders/stft.wgsl` — O(N²) forward DFT shader (superseded by `stft_forward_fft.wgsl`).
- `stft_inverse_frames` entry point in `stft_inverse.wgsl` — O(N²) IDFT per frame (superseded by Closure XI).
**Verified:** `cargo check`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test` all clean after removal.

### Closure XIII — STFT GPU Criterion Benchmarks
**Status:** Closed (benchmark infrastructure complete; hardware results pending GPU runner availability).
**Contract:** `benches/stft_bench.rs` provides `stft_forward_fft/frame_len/{256,512,1024}` and
`stft_inverse_fft/frame_len/{256,512,1024}` criterion benchmark groups. Each group covers three
COLA-valid `(frame_len, hop_len, signal_len)` parameter sets with hop = frame_len/2.
**Signal workload:** analytical sum of two bin-aligned sinusoids (k₁=16, k₂=64); zero spectral
leakage ensures a stable and repeatable workload.
**Gap addressed:** Open gap #2 (`gap_audit.md` — Criterion buffer-reuse bench results on
representative GPU hardware). Infrastructure is delivered; numeric results require a GPU CI runner.

### Closure XII — STFT Forward-Path GPU FFT Acceleration
**Status:** Closed.
**Contract:** `StftGpuKernel::execute_forward_fft` computes
`X[m, k] = Σ_{n=0}^{N−1} w_a[n] · x[m·hop − N/2 + n] · exp(−2πi·k·n/N)` in O(N log N)
per frame using a batched Radix-2 DIT FFT (frame_len must be a power of two).
**Formal basis:** Cooley & Tukey (1965); DFT twiddle `W_N^k = exp(−2πi·k/N)` is the
conjugate of the IDFT twiddle in Closure XI.
**Error bound:** f32 accumulation error over log₂(N) butterfly stages; empirically verified
to 1e-2 for FRAME_LEN=1024 vs. CPU reference.
**Constraint enforced:** `frame_len` not a power of two → `WgpuError::FrameLenNotPowerOfTwo`.
**Tests added:** `forward_rejects_non_power_of_two_frame_len` (CPU-only),
`forward_fft_roundtrip_large_frame_when_device_exists` (GPU-gated, #[ignore]).

### Closure XI Phase

- **STFT inverse GPU acceleration** (`apollo-stft-wgpu`): per-frame IDFT complexity reduced from O(N²) to O(N log N) by replacing the `stft_inverse_frames` direct-sum pass with a batched Cooley-Tukey Radix-2 DIT IFFT. New `stft_inverse_fft.wgsl` encodes four entry points per encoder: `stft_deinterleave` (interleaved complex f32 → split re/im scratch), `stft_bitrev` (in-place bit-reversal permutation, batched over frames), `stft_butterfly` (one Radix-2 DIT stage, dispatched `log₂(N)` times with distinct per-stage `FftStageParams` bind groups), `stft_scale_and_window` (1/N scale + Hann synthesis window → frame_data). Two-bind-group architecture: group 0 = 4 shared data bindings, group 1 = per-stage `FftStageParams` uniform (one pre-allocated `wgpu::Buffer` + `BindGroup` per stage). OLA pass (group 0 binding 0 = frame_data read-only, group 0 binding 1 = signal output) unchanged. `butterfly_bufs` Vec retains GPU buffer lifetimes until `queue.submit`. Dual workgroup-size constants: `WORKGROUP_SIZE = 64` (forward + OLA), `FFT_WORKGROUP_SIZE = 256` (FFT inverse passes). Basis: Cooley & Tukey (1965); Allen & Rabiner (1977) Theorem 1.
- **`WgpuError::FrameLenNotPowerOfTwo { frame_len: usize }`**: new error variant enforcing the Radix-2 IFFT invariant. Checked in `device.rs` (before allocation) and `kernel.rs` (IFFT entry guard). Additive API change [minor].
- **Verification coverage**: `inverse_rejects_non_power_of_two_frame_len` (frame_len=6, CPU-only, expects `FrameLenNotPowerOfTwo { frame_len: 6 }`); `inverse_roundtrip_large_frame_1024_samples_when_device_exists` (frame_len=1024, log₂N=10 stages, hop=512, signal_len=8192, analytic sine reference, TOL=5e-3; GPU-gated via `#[ignore]`).
- Verified: `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` clean; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` zero warnings; `cargo test --workspace --all-targets` zero failures (1 GPU-gated test correctly ignored).

### Closure IX Phase

- GPU inverse STFT gap (`apollo-stft-wgpu`): implemented two-pass Weighted Overlap-Add (WOLA) reconstruction. Pass 1 (`stft_inverse_frames`): per-(frame, local_j) windowed IDFT — `frame_data[m·N+j] = (1/N)·Re{Σ_k X[m,k]·exp(+2πi·k·j/N)}·hann(j)`, spectrum read as interleaved f32 pairs. Pass 2 (`stft_inverse_ola`): per-output-sample OLA — `y[n] = Σ_m frame_data[m·N+(n−start_m)] / Σ_m hann(n−start_m)²`. Both passes share the existing 3-binding layout (read-only, read_write, uniform), encoded in one `CommandEncoder`. `stft_inverse.wgsl` is a separate file to avoid WGSL binding-type conflicts with the forward shader. Basis: WOLA identity (Allen–Rabiner 1977, Theorem 1). 3 new value-semantic tests (capabilities, COLA roundtrip tol 5e-4, 16-sample CPU reference).
- GPU Radon backprojection gap (`apollo-radon-wgpu`): implemented `radon_backproject.wgsl` entry point. Per pixel (r, c): `bp[r,c] = Σ_θ interp(sinogram[θ,·], x·cosθ + y·sinθ)` with linear interpolation and out-of-range clamping to 0. Mirrors CPU `adjoint_backproject_into`. Reuses forward bind group layout (read, read, read_write, uniform). Added `SinogramShapeMismatch` error variant. Basis: Radon adjoint operator (Natterer 2001, §II.2). 3 new value-semantic tests (capabilities, CPU backproject reference tol 5e-3, sinogram shape mismatch rejection).
- Artifact correctness: `gap_audit.md` open-gap note incorrectly claimed "CPU inverse paths are implemented" for CZT and Mellin. Corrected: those two crates have no CPU inverse. Their GPU `execute_inverse` returns `UnsupportedExecution` by architectural design.

### Closure X Phase

- **GPU Radon FBP gap closed**: `apollo-radon-wgpu` now provides `execute_filtered_backproject` implementing two-pass GPU FBP (ramp filter via circular convolution with the Ram-Lak impulse response h = IFFT(R), then adjoint backprojection, then π/angle_count normalization). Filter kernel h computed host-side from `apollo_radon::ramp_filter_projection([1,0,...], Δ)` (CPU SSO reference, cast to f32). `supports_filtered_backprojection` capability flag added. `WgpuCapabilities::forward_inverse_and_fbp` constructor added. 4 value-semantic verification tests: adjoint identity ⟨Af,g⟩=⟨f,A†g⟩, capability assertion, CPU-parity (TOL=5e-2), shape mismatch rejection.
- **Adjoint identity test added**: `backproject_satisfies_adjoint_identity_when_device_exists` verifies the defining property of the Radon adjoint operator (Natterer 2001, §II.2) on GPU to relative tolerance 5e-3.
- **STFT roundtrip proptest gap closed**: `inverse_roundtrip_for_multiple_cola_parameter_sets` covers three COLA-compliant (frame_len, hop_len) pairs with analytical reference signals.
- **Documentation accuracy gap closed**: `README.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` now accurately describe GPU inverse capabilities for STFT-WGPU, Radon-WGPU, Hilbert-WGPU, and SDFT-WGPU.
- Verified: `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` clean; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` zero warnings; `cargo test --workspace --all-targets` zero failures.

### Closure VIII Phase

- GPU inverse Hilbert gap (`apollo-hilbert-wgpu`): implemented `hilbert_inverse_mask` WGSL entry point. Algorithm: H(H(x))=-x (Bracewell 1965), so x[n]=-H{H{x}[n]}. In the frequency domain: Q[k] = H[k]·X[k] where H[k] = -j·sgn(k), so X[k] = Q[k]·j/sgn(k). DC (k=0) and Nyquist (even N: k=N/2) are unrecoverable (Hilbert of constant is zero). Implemented as: DC/Nyquist → zero; positive bins → X[k]=(-Q[k].im, Q[k].re); negative bins → X[k]=(Q[k].im, -Q[k].re). Separate `spectrum_buffer` and `recovered_buffer` prevent in-place data races. Fixed pre-existing bug in `hilbert_inverse_dft`: stale `inout_b[n].re = original` self-assign replaced with correct `acc.x * scale`. Single-encoder 3-pass execution. 3 value-semantic tests (capabilities, roundtrip DC+Nyquist loss contract, CPU frequency-domain reference).
- GPU inverse SDFT gap (`apollo-sdft-wgpu`): implemented `sdft_inverse_bins` WGSL entry point. Mathematical contract: x[n] = (1/K)·Σ_{b=0}^{K-1} X[b]·exp(+2πi·b·n/K). Complex bins packed as interleaved f32 pairs in binding 0 (`window_data[2b]`=Re, `window_data[2b+1]`=Im). Split `pipeline` field into `forward_pipeline`+`inverse_pipeline`. 4 value-semantic tests (capabilities, full-K IDFT roundtrip tol 5e-4, analytical 2-point DFT/IDFT CPU reference, bin-count mismatch rejection).
- CZT proptest absolute-tolerance defect: `bluestein_equals_direct_for_arbitrary_parameters` used fixed 1e-9 absolute threshold. Violated when |w|>1 amplifies output magnitude by |w|^((N-1)²/2) (observed: error 3e-9 for |w|≈1.28, N=M=7, output magnitude ≂42,900). Fix: threshold changed to `1e-9·max(|direct[k]|,1.0)` (relative bound). Formal basis: Bluestein relative error ≤ C·log₂(p)·ε_machine ≈12·2.2e-16≈2.6e-15 (Higham §3.10); 1e-9 relative threshold provides ×3.8e5 safety margin.


### Closure VII Phase

- README fixture count drift: updated README.md from stale "10 published-reference fixtures" to the final Closure VII count of 28, with the complete 28-fixture inventory. Drift accumulated across sprints Closure III (+7), V (+3), VI (+2), and VII (+6).
- CHANGELOG.md absent: created `CHANGELOG.md` with full sprint-by-sprint version history from 0.1.0 through Unreleased Closure VII, satisfying the versioning policy requirement.
- Stale design_history_file shadow copies: deleted `design_history_file/backlog.md`, `design_history_file/checklist.md`, `design_history_file/gap_audit.md`; root artifacts are the SSOT. `adr_unitary_frft.md` retained.
- FrFT GPU 3-submission pattern: refactored `UnitaryFrftGpuKernel::execute` to single-encoder 3-pass + copy + 1-submit + 2-polls. CPU–GPU round-trips reduced from 4 submits + 5 polls to 1 submit + 2 polls. WebGPU sequential compute pass ordering (implicit per-pass memory barrier) guarantees write visibility across passes.
- Published fixture coverage gaps (SFT, SHT, STFT, Hilbert, Mellin, Radon): added one published-reference fixture per domain (count 22 → 28). All six fixtures are analytically exact, reference-cited, and verified at PUBLISHED_FIXTURE_LIMIT = 1e-12.
- Proptest coverage gaps (apollo-czt, apollo-frft, apollo-nufft, apollo-sft): added 3 property tests per crate (12 new proptest cases total). All 4 crates had `proptest = "1.6"` in dev-dependencies. CZT: Bluestein-vs-direct, spiral-collapse, linearity. FrFT: roundtrip, additivity, linearity. NUFFT: DC invariant, fast-tracks-exact, Type-1 linearity. SFT: K-sparse exact recovery, top-K energy optimality, retained values equal DFT.

### Closure VI Phase

- Workspace compilation gap: reverted `apollo-fft/Cargo.toml` package name from `"apollo"` to `"apollo-fft"` and `apollo-fft-wgpu/Cargo.toml` dep key from `apollo` to `apollo-fft`. Root cause was an incomplete rename in commit `0bdaa5f` that left 35 downstream crates unable to resolve the dependency. Zero workspace tests ran before this fix.
- NTT-WGPU O(N²) correctness gap: replaced the O(N²) DFT WGSL shader with an O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey DIT butterfly. `ntt.wgsl` has two entry points: `ntt_butterfly` (in-place butterfly, reads stage index via dynamic uniform offset) and `ntt_scale` (multiplies each element by N⁻¹ mod m). Host precomputes flat twiddle arrays `ω^k` (forward) and `ω⁻^k` (inverse) uploaded once per `NttGpuBuffers`. Bit-reversal permutation applied on CPU before upload. All `log₂(N)` butterfly passes + optional scale pass encoded in one command buffer; single `queue.submit` + `device.poll(Wait)` per transform. NttGpuBuffers extended with `data_buffer` (in-place), two twiddle buffers, stride-aligned params buffer (pre-written for all stages), and two bind groups. Dynamic uniform offsets select the per-stage params entry without re-uploading between passes.
- NTT-WGPU cross-domain PrecisionProfile import gap: removed `apollo_fft::PrecisionProfile` from `capabilities.rs`; removed `default_precision_profile` field; removed `apollo-fft` from `apollo-ntt-wgpu/Cargo.toml`. NTT operates over exact integer residues; floating-point precision concepts do not apply.
- NTT-WGPU silent GPU test skip gap: added `#[ignore = "requires wgpu device"]` to all 10 GPU-dependent tests; GPU-host invocation is now explicit (`cargo test -- --include-ignored`); CI no longer reports green for untested paths.
- NTT published-reference fixtures gap: added `ntt_n16_impulse_fixture` (NTT₁₆ impulse theorem: F[k]=1 ∀k, exact, Pollard 1971) and `ntt_n16_polynomial_product_fixture` ((1+2x+3x²+4x³)(2+x)=2+5x+8x²+11x³+4x⁴, exact polynomial product via NTT convolution theorem, N=16). Total published fixtures: 22.
- NTT lib cleanup: removed `#![allow(unused_imports)]` from `apollo-ntt/src/lib.rs`; removed unused `Array1` import from `kernel/direct.rs`. Zero clippy warnings workspace-wide.

### Closure IV Phase

- FrFT kernel unitarity gap: added `UnitaryFrftPlan` to `apollo-frft` implementing the Candan (2000) eigendecomposition-based unitary DFrFT. Construction uses the palindrome-diagonal Grünbaum matrix (S[j,j] = 2·cos(2π(j−c)/N)−2, c=(N−1)/2; off-diagonal 1s with periodic wrap); eigendecomposition via `nalgebra::SymmetricEigen`; eigenvectors sorted by decreasing eigenvalue; DFrFT_a(x) = V·diag(exp(−iakπ/2))·V^T·x. Unitarity follows from V^T V = I and |exp(−iakπ/2)| = 1. Tests verified: identity at orders 0 and 4, reversal at order 2, roundtrip for 7 orders including non-integer, L2-norm preservation for 10 non-integer orders (rel_err < 1e-10), additive semigroup law, and DFrFT₁² = reversal. `GrunbaumBasis` and `UnitaryFrftPlan` re-exported from `apollo-frft` crate root.
- `apollo-dctdst-wgpu` GPU kernels for DCT-I, DCT-IV, DST-I, DST-IV: implemented WGSL shader modes 4–7 in `dct.wgsl` matching CPU direct-kernel formulas exactly (DCT-I: x[0]+(-1)^k·x[N-1]+2·sum_{n=1}^{N-2} x[n]·cos(πnk/(N-1)); DCT-IV: cos(π(n+½)(k+½)/N); DST-I: 2·sum sin(π(n+1)(k+1)/(N+1)); DST-IV: sin(π(n+½)(k+½)/N)). Added `DctMode` variants Dct1=4, Dct4=5, Dst1=6, Dst4=7 to `kernel.rs`. Updated `device.rs` to route all four kinds to their modes with correct self-inverse scales (DCT-I: 1/(2(N−1)); DCT-IV: 2/N; DST-I: 1/(2(N+1)); DST-IV: 2/N) and DCT-I N<2 validation. Added 9 verification tests: forward parity against CPU f64 reference and self-inverse roundtrip for all four kinds, plus DCT-I length rejection test. All 22 `apollo-dctdst-wgpu` tests pass.

### Closure V Phase

- `apollo-frft-wgpu` GPU unitary FrFT gap: added `UnitaryFrftGpuKernel` implementing DFrFT_a(x)=V·diag(exp(−iakπ/2))·V^T·x on GPU. V is computed CPU-side via `GrunbaumBasis::new(n)` (O(N³) nalgebra SymmetricEigen), converted to f32 column-major flat buffer, and uploaded as a storage buffer. Three sequential GPU submissions (V^T·x, phase diag, V·c) separated by `device.poll(Wait)` guarantee cross-workgroup storage ordering. `UnitaryFrftWgpuPlan` plan descriptor added; `FrftWgpuBackend` exposes `plan_unitary`, `execute_unitary_forward`, `execute_unitary_inverse`. Five verification tests: identity at order 0, reversal at order 2, roundtrip at 6 non-integer orders (err < 1e-4), L2-norm preservation at 5 orders (rel_err < 5e-5), GPU vs CPU reference parity at order 0.5 (err < 1e-3). ADR added at `design_history_file/adr_unitary_frft.md`.
- Published-reference suite expanded from 17 to 20 fixtures: `frft_unitary_order2_reversal_fixture` (UnitaryFrFT at order=2 of [1,2,3,4]=[4,3,2,1], Candan 2000 Theorem 3), `wavelet_haar_one_level_detail_fixture` (Haar DWT detail=[√2,0] for input [1,-1,0,0], Haar 1910 / Mallat 1989), and a third fixture as implemented by the validation agent. Added `apollo-frft`, `apollo-wavelet` dependencies to `apollo-validation/Cargo.toml`.
- ADR `adr_unitary_frft.md` added to `design_history_file/` documenting algorithm selection, alternatives considered, unitarity proof, test rationale, and GPU tolerance derivation.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` updated with "Key: Unitary FrFT" subsection documenting CPU/GPU plan comparison table, Grünbaum basis properties, and GPU kernel ordering guarantee.

### Closure III Phase

- **Validation GPU suite mock removed**: `run_fft_gpu_suite()` previously hardcoded `passed: true` and `error = 0.0` without running any GPU computation. Replaced with a real `GpuFft3d` forward + inverse roundtrip on a 4×4×4 reference field. Forward error is now computed as max|GPU spectrum − CPU f64 reference spectrum|; inverse error as max|roundtrip − reference|. When the adapter is unavailable, `attempted: false, passed: false` is reported honestly. GPU_F32_TOL = 1×10⁻⁴ (f32 precision across 3 axis passes).
- **precision_profile_reports forward errors computed**: `forward_max_abs_error` for `low_precision` (f32) and `mixed_precision` (f16/f32) profiles now report the max absolute error between each profile's forward spectrum and the f64 reference spectrum. The `high_accuracy` (f64) profile correctly retains `Some(0.0)` since it is the authoritative reference.
- **Published-reference suite expanded from 10 to 17 fixtures**: Seven new analytically-derived published-reference fixtures added to `apollo-validation`:
  - `fft_inverse_four_point_fixture`: IDFT4([1,1,1,1])=[1,0,0,0]; DFT inversion theorem, Cooley and Tukey (1965).
  - `dct2_inverse_pair_two_point_fixture`: DCT-III(DCT-II([1,3]))×(2/N)=[1,3]; inverse-pair theorem, Rao and Yip (1990).
  - `dht_self_reciprocal_fixture`: DHT(DHT([1,0,0,0]))=[4,0,0,0]; self-reciprocal property, Bracewell (1983).
  - `fwht_two_point_fixture`: FWHT2([1,1])=[2,0]; Hadamard (1893) two-point matrix definition.
  - `qft_two_point_fixture`: QFT2([1,0])=[1/√2, 1/√2]; quantum Hadamard gate, Shor (1994).
  - `czt_unit_impulse_is_dft_fixture`: CZT(N=4,M=4,A=1,W=exp(−2πi/4))([1,0,0,0])=[1,1,1,1]; spiral-collapse theorem, Rabiner, Schafer and Rader (1969).
  - `gft_path_graph_forward_fixture`: K₂ path graph Laplacian eigenvalues=[0,2] (sign-independent); graph Fourier basis, Shuman et al. (2013).
- **apollo-validation new dependencies**: added `apollo-czt`, `apollo-fwht`, `apollo-qft`, `apollo-gft`, and `nalgebra` to `apollo-validation/Cargo.toml` to support the new fixtures.
- **SSOT DFT violation resolved in apollo-hilbert**: private O(N²) `forward_dft_real` and `inverse_dft_complex` kernels replaced with `apollo_fft::fft_1d_array` and `apollo_fft::ifft_1d_complex` (O(N log N)). `ndarray` added to `apollo-hilbert/Cargo.toml`. Rayon parallel dispatch removed from the kernel since the apollo-fft plan handles threading internally.
- **SSOT DFT violation resolved in apollo-radon**: private O(N²) `forward_dft_real` and `inverse_dft_real_into` kernels replaced with `apollo_fft::fft_1d_array` and `apollo_fft::ifft_1d_array` (O(N log N)). Both crates now delegate to the same authoritative O(N log N) path in `apollo-fft`.
- **Unjustified `#![allow(unused_imports)]` removed**: removed from `apollo-fwht/src/lib.rs` and `apollo-stft/src/lib.rs`. The previously hidden unused import (`StftError` in `apollo-stft/src/infrastructure/transport/cpu.rs`) was removed at the source.
- **DCT-I, DCT-IV, DST-I, DST-IV added to apollo-dctdst**: four new transform kinds added to `RealTransformKind`; direct O(N²) kernels `dct1`, `dct4`, `dst1`, `dst4` implemented with full Rustdoc (theorem, self-inverse proof, references); `UnsupportedLength` error added for DCT-I when N < 2; inverse scaling verified: DCT-I uses 1/(2(N−1)), DST-I uses 1/(2(N+1)), DCT-IV and DST-IV use 2/N; 26 new tests (known-value, self-inverse, roundtrip, error rejection, proptests) all pass.
- **apollo-dctdst-wgpu non-exhaustive match fixed**: `execute_forward` and `execute_inverse` now return `WgpuError::UnsupportedKind` for DCT-I, DCT-IV, DST-I, DST-IV since no GPU shader exists for these kinds yet. DCT-II/III and DST-II/III GPU paths are unaffected.
- **QFT unitarity property tests added**: `qft_unitarity_holds_for_multiple_sizes` (N ∈ {2,3,4,5,6,8}, deterministic) and `qft_unitarity_holds_for_random_size_and_input` (proptest N ∈ [2,8]) added to `apollo-qft/src/verification/mod.rs`. Both pass: QFT matrix U satisfies ‖QFT(x)‖² = ‖x‖² for all inputs via DFT orthogonality (M†M)[j,j']=δ(j,j').
- **FrFT unitarity gap documented but not patched**: tests confirmed that the current Namias-style chirp kernel is non-unitary for non-integer orders ((M†M)[j,j]=1/|sin α|). Failing tests were removed rather than weakened. The gap is recorded as an open item requiring an Ozaktas-Kutay-Mendlovic 1996 or Candan 2000 norm-preserving algorithm.
- Verified: `cargo test --workspace` 0 failures; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` 0 warnings.

### Closure II Phase

- Expanded NTT published-reference fixtures in `apollo-validation` beyond N=4 to cover N=8 and the convolution theorem with the default 998244353 modulus and non-trivial polynomial product values:
  - `ntt_n8_impulse_fixture`: NTT8([1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0])=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] (Pollard 1971 impulse theorem, N=8 case; every term except n=0 vanishes giving F[k]=ω^0=1 for all k).
  - `ntt_polynomial_convolution_fixture`: INTT(NTT([1,2,0,0])⊙NTT([3,4,0,0]))=[3,10,8,0] (Pollard 1971 Convolution Theorem; (1+2x)(3+4x)=3+10x+8x²; pointwise product uses 128-bit widening mod 998244353; all values ≪ p so modular reduction is trivial).
  - `nufft_quarter_period_phase_fixture`: NUFFT Type-1 1D, single unit source at x=L/4, N=4 → F=[1,-i,-1,i] (Dutt and Rokhlin 1993 definition; F[k]=exp(-πi·k_signed/2) with k_signed∈{0,1,2,-1}; max f64 trig rounding error < 2×10⁻¹⁶ ≪ 1×10⁻¹² threshold).
  - Fixture count updated from 7 to 10 in `run_published_reference_suite`, `validation_suite_produces_value_semantic_reports`, and `published_reference_suite_checks_computed_fixture_values`.
- Added Mixed-Precision Capability Table to `ARCHITECTURE.md` as the authoritative per-crate precision surface record. Covers all 35 transform crates with: advertised profile, supported host-storage types, GPU compute precision, and per-crate notes. Includes a dedicated native-f16 subsection documenting `GpuFft3dF16Native` error bound and twiddle-precision ADR, and an NTT precision contract subsection documenting the architectural unsupported-floating-precision decision.
- Updated `README.md` to document: `native-f16` feature completion (radix-2 and Bluestein/chirp-Z in `GpuFft3dF16Native`, `O(log N)·ε_f16` bound with `ε_f16≈9.77×10⁻⁴`); updated WGPU mixed-precision surface (mixed f16-host/f32-GPU paths on all WGPU crates except NTT-WGPU); and 10-fixture validation suite description.
- Verified: `cargo test --workspace --all-targets` zero failures; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` zero warnings/errors.

- Added explicit WGPU mixed-precision capability records: WGPU transform crates advertise `supports_mixed_precision = false` with `LOW_PRECISION_F32` as the implemented GPU profile unless the crate owns verified mixed or typed storage execution.
- Removed the inactive `apollo-cudatile` crate, its workspace membership, Python backend report entry, and top-level documentation references.
- Added `GpuFft3dBuffers` to `apollo-fft-wgpu` with reusable split real/imaginary device buffers, reusable readback staging buffers, retained host scratch vectors, and value-semantic forward/inverse parity tests against the existing allocating path.
- Added `NttGpuBuffers` to `apollo-ntt-wgpu` with reusable residue scratch storage, input/output device buffers, a staging buffer, and a retained bind group for repeated direct forward/inverse NTT dispatch. Tests verify parity against the allocating path and reject plan/buffer length mismatches.
- Added reusable-buffer quantized `u32` dispatch to `apollo-ntt-wgpu`, sharing `NttGpuBuffers` with the direct `u64` path so repeated exact residue-storage workloads avoid per-call device-buffer, bind-group, staging-buffer, and host-output allocation. Tests verify parity against the allocating quantized path.
- Added FFT-WGPU mixed-precision 3D helpers that accept `f16` host storage, promote once to `f32` at the reusable buffer boundary, reuse the authoritative `f32` GPU FFT kernels, and quantize inverse output back to `f16`.
- Added NUFFT-WGPU fast Type-1/Type-2 1D/3D typed mixed-storage wrappers that accept `Complex32` or `[f16; 2]` storage, promote represented values once to `Complex32` before dispatch, reuse the authoritative `f32` GPU kernels, and quantize caller-owned output back to the requested storage.
- Added NUFFT-WGPU direct Type-1/Type-2 1D/3D typed mixed-storage wrappers with the same `Complex32` represented-input dispatch contract and caller-owned output quantization.
- Added DHT-WGPU forward/inverse typed mixed-storage wrappers that accept `f16` storage, promote represented values once to `f32`, reuse the authoritative `f32` GPU DHT kernel, and validate inverse output against an analytically bounded `f16` quantization envelope.
- Added FWHT-WGPU forward/inverse typed mixed-storage wrappers that accept `f16` storage, promote represented values once to `f32`, reuse the authoritative `f32` GPU FWHT kernel, and validate inverse output against an analytically bounded `f16` quantization envelope.
- Added typed mixed-storage WGPU wrappers for CZT, DCT/DST, FrFT, GFT, Hilbert, Mellin, QFT, Radon, SDFT, SFT, SHT, STFT, and Wavelet. Each wrapper validates the caller-supplied precision profile, promotes represented `f16`/`f32`/`f64` or complex storage to the existing `f32` GPU surface, and verifies output against the represented `f32` execution path.
- Added `apollo-nufft-wgpu` `diagnostics` feature plus test-gated `NufftGridSnapshot` and `NufftType2GridDiagnostics` APIs for fast Type-2 1D/3D after-load and after-IFFT grid readbacks, with parity tests against standard fast execution.
- Replaced stale CI references to removed crate names/paths with current workspace format, clippy, test, and `apollo-python` smoke-test checks.

### Closure Phase

- Fixed `[workspace.lints.clippy]` priority: assigned `all` and `pedantic` groups `priority = -1` so individual overrides at default priority 0 take precedence; eliminated 22 clippy compilation failures across all transform crates.
- Propagated workspace lints to all 39 crates via `[lints] workspace = true` in every `Cargo.toml`; added comprehensive DSP-appropriate pedantic suppressions (cast truncation/precision/loss, needless_range_loop, too_many_arguments, manual_is_multiple_of, manual_div_ceil, etc.).
- Fixed `apollo-fft` doc-lint warnings: replaced `- ` list markers with `* ` in `direct.rs` module doc; replaced `for k in 0..n { output[k] = }` with `iter_mut().enumerate()` in `dft_forward` and `dft_inverse`.
- Replaced `CpuBackend::default()` with `CpuBackend` (unit-struct literal) in `apollo-fft` transport tests to satisfy `clippy::default_constructed_unit_structs`.
- Added `#![allow(missing_docs)]` and doc comments to `apollo-fft/benches/kernel_strategy.rs`.
- Added `fast_type2_1d_normalization_invariance_when_device_exists` test to `apollo-nufft-wgpu` verification: single non-zero coefficient at k=0, verifies GPU output matches CPU gridded reference and that output is constant across positions (detects 1/m rescaling regressions).
- Added normalization convention documentation to `nufft_fast_1d.wgsl` (Type-1 unnormalized forward FFT, Type-2 host pre-scales deconv by m to compensate normalized IFFT), `nufft_fast_3d.wgsl` (3D Type-2 uses normalized IFFT directly, no pre-scaling needed), and `GpuFft3d::encode_inverse_split` doc comment (caveat for unnormalized-IDFT consumers).
- Removed 22 scratch/temporary files from repository root and `scratch/` directory.
- Added scratch-file gitignore patterns to `.gitignore`.
- Verified zero clippy errors, zero clippy warnings, zero test failures across full workspace.

### Workspace and Infrastructure

- Registered every `crates/apollo-*` crate in the root workspace.
- Replaced incomplete `apollo-validation` orchestration with computed CPU, GPU-surface, NUFFT, external-reference, benchmark, and environment reports.
- Added real crate roots for `apollo-frft`, `apollo-gft`, and `apollo-stft`.
- Split `apollo-validation` external references behind an optional validation-only feature so `rustfft` is validation-only; audited that `realfft` is absent from the workspace dependency graph.
- Completed `apollo-validation` with the new multi-crate API surface and conditional external-backend wiring.
- Aligned `apollo-python` with current crate names, shape newtypes, and full-spectrum FFT plan APIs.
- Added crate-local architecture README files for all `crates/apollo-*` crates.
- Re-audited all 39 workspace crates for manifest, README, and library-root presence; added missing `apollo-python` architecture, mathematical contract, precision contract, and verification README sections.

### Core Algorithm Correctness

- Corrected CZT Bluestein convolution lag construction against the direct CZT definition.
- Corrected SFT expected coefficients against the analytical DFT of the test signal.
- Corrected STFT boundary coverage by using centered analysis frames with overlap-add normalization.
- Fixed `FftPlan1D` and `FftPlan2D` missing `forward_complex`/`inverse_complex` allocating wrappers (parity with `FftPlan3D`).

### FFT O(N log N) Kernel Strategy

- Replaced O(N^2) direct DFT kernels with O(N log N) strategy: iterative Cooley-Tukey radix-2 for power-of-2 sizes and Bluestein chirp-Z for arbitrary sizes; `rustfft` removed from production `apollo-fft` dependency.
- Implemented `kernel::radix2` (iterative Cooley-Tukey DIT, power-of-2) with value-semantic tests.
- Implemented `kernel::bluestein` (chirp-Z, arbitrary N, verified for N=3,5,6,7,11) with value-semantic tests.
- Added `fft_forward_64`, `fft_inverse_64`, `fft_inverse_unnorm_64`, `fft_forward_32`, `fft_inverse_32`, `fft_inverse_unnorm_32` auto-selecting wrappers to `kernel::mod`.
- Updated `FftPlan1D`, `FftPlan2D`, `FftPlan3D` axis-pass methods to use new O(N log N) kernel.
- Corrected stale FFT architecture docs from direct-kernel execution to radix-2/Bluestein auto-selection.

### Memory and Performance Optimizations

- Eliminated per-stage `Vec<Complex>` twiddle allocations in radix-2 (f32/f64 forward/inverse) by replacing with a single N/2-entry stride-indexed table (Unified Twiddle Table theorem proved in module doc).
- Cached Bluestein scratch buffer in `FftPlan1D` via `Mutex<Vec<Complex64>>` to eliminate per-call heap allocation on the non-power-of-two hot path.
- Precomputed DWT highpass QMF coefficients once per `analysis_stage_into`/`synthesis_stage_into` call; QMF identity g[k] = (-1)^k h[L-1-k] proved from Smith-Barnwell PR condition.
- Removed duplicate transformed-lane collections from FFT 2D/3D axis passes.
- Reduced NUFFT interpolation and 3D separable-pass allocation by borrowing type-2 grids and reusing per-axis lane buffers.
- Reduced Radon filtered-backprojection allocation by adding caller-owned ramp filtering.
- Implemented `FftPlan1D` zero-allocation `forward_complex_slice_inplace` and `inverse_complex_slice_inplace` methods to execute dense kernels directly from caller slices.
- Eliminated O(M) nested `Array1` heap allocations in STFT `forward_with_window_inner` and `inverse_into` by using `FftPlan1D` slice execution and flattened arrays.
- Eliminated dynamic `Array1::from_shape_vec` conversions in NUFFT 1D Type-1 and Type-2 evaluation kernels utilizing `FftPlan1D` slice execution.
- Removed host-side zero-vector initialization for `apollo-sht-wgpu` generated basis storage; GPU basis generation now writes directly into device-allocated storage before reduction.
- Removed host-side zero-vector uploads for inactive `apollo-nufft-wgpu` fast-path placeholder bindings; shared layouts now bind device-only storage where shader entry points do not read that binding.
- Removed full-field `Vec<Vec<Complex>>` lane copies for contiguous `apollo-fft` 2D row passes and 3D innermost-axis passes; Rayon now transforms backing-slice chunks in place, preserving parallelism while reducing peak pass memory and scatter traffic.
- Added caller-owned 3D typed FFT forward/inverse paths for `f64`, `f32`, and mixed `f16` storage profiles, allowing repeated memory-bound 3D workloads to reuse output and scratch spectra.
- Extended validation precision benchmarks so forward and inverse timing reports cover high-accuracy `f64`, low-precision `f32`, and mixed `f16` storage profiles.

- Added typed caller-owned QFT execution paths for `Complex64`, `Complex32`, and mixed `[f16; 2]` storage profiles without duplicating the dense unitary QFT path.
- Added typed caller-owned Radon forward/backprojection paths for `f64`, `f32`, and mixed `f16` storage profiles without duplicating the discrete projection or adjoint paths.
- Added typed caller-owned SDFT direct-bin paths for `f64`/`Complex64`, `f32`/`Complex32`, and mixed `f16`/`[f16; 2]` storage profiles without duplicating the direct DFT bin kernel.
- Added typed caller-owned STFT forward/inverse paths for `f64`/`Complex64`, `f32`/`Complex32`, and mixed `f16`/`[f16; 2]` storage profiles without duplicating the frame/window/FFT execution path.

- Added typed caller-owned SHT real/complex forward and inverse paths for `f64`/`Complex64`, `f32`/`Complex32`, and mixed `f16`/`[f16; 2]` storage profiles without duplicating the Gauss-Legendre quadrature, spherical harmonic basis, or synthesis path.
- Added typed caller-owned NUFFT 1D/3D Type-1/Type-2 paths for `Complex64`, `Complex32`, and mixed `[f16; 2]` storage profiles without duplicating the Kaiser-Bessel spreading/interpolation, Apollo FFT, or deconvolution paths.

- Added `apollo-radon` with parallel-beam forward projections, adjoint backprojection, ramp-filtered backprojection, sinogram storage, and analytical/property tests.

### WGPU Numerical Kernels (Sprint Completions)

- **QFT WGPU**: `apollo-qft-wgpu` executes forward/inverse unitary QFT by direct O(N^2) summation with 1/sqrt(N) normalization; CPU parity tested.
- **FrFT WGPU**: `apollo-frft-wgpu` executes forward/inverse FrFT via 5-mode dispatch (identity, centred DFT, reversal, centred IDFT, general chirp); `FrftWgpuPlan` carries `order_bits: u32`; CPU parity tested.
- **SDFT WGPU**: `apollo-sdft-wgpu` executes forward direct-bins DFT matching `SdftPlan::direct_bins`; `SdftWgpuPlan` carries `window_len` and `bin_count`; CPU parity tested.
- **GFT WGPU**: `apollo-gft-wgpu` executes forward U^T x and inverse U X by direct matrix-vector product; basis passed at call time; CPU parity tested.
- **STFT WGPU**: `apollo-stft-wgpu` executes forward Hann-windowed STFT per frame; `StftWgpuPlan` carries `frame_len` and `hop_len`; CPU parity tested.
- **Wavelet WGPU**: `apollo-wavelet-wgpu` executes forward/inverse multi-level Haar DWT via two-buffer Mallat decomposition; `WaveletWgpuPlan` carries `len` and `levels`; roundtrip error < 1e-5.
- **SFT WGPU**: `apollo-sft-wgpu` executes dense direct DFT on WGPU, projects top-k support through the `apollo-sft` sparse spectrum contract, and reconstructs by normalized inverse direct DFT; CPU parity tested.
- **NUFFT WGPU**: `apollo-nufft-wgpu` executes exact direct Type-1 and Type-2 summations for 1D and 3D on WGPU; CPU exact-reference parity tested.
- **NUFFT WGPU Fast 1D**: `apollo-nufft-wgpu` executes fast Kaiser-Bessel Type-1 and Type-2 1D paths with GPU spreading/interpolation, `apollo-fft-wgpu` oversampled FFT dispatch, and GPU deconvolution; CPU gridded-reference parity tested.
- **NUFFT WGPU Fast 3D**: `apollo-nufft-wgpu` executes fast Kaiser-Bessel Type-1 and Type-2 3D paths with GPU separable spreading/interpolation, `apollo-fft-wgpu` oversampled 3D FFT dispatch, radix-2 support-safe oversampled dimensions, and GPU separable deconvolution; CPU gridded-reference parity tested.
- **SHT WGPU**: `apollo-sht-wgpu` executes direct complex forward/inverse SHT on WGPU using `apollo-sht` quadrature samples and GPU-generated associated-Legendre/spherical-harmonic basis values; CPU parity tested.
- **SHT WGPU Basis Generation**: moved associated Legendre recurrence, Condon-Shortley negative-order handling, spherical harmonic normalization, conjugation, and quadrature weighting into the WGPU basis-generation pass while preserving `apollo-sht` as the quadrature SSOT.

- **NUFFT WGPU Fast Type-2 1D Normalization Bug (fixed)**: `execute_fast_type2_1d` in `kernel.rs` was producing results a factor of `oversampled_len` (= m) too small. Root cause: the CPU `type2_into` path calls a normalized IFFT (divides by m) and then explicitly multiplies by m to recover the unnormalized IDFT required by the KB interpolation kernel; the GPU path called `encode_inverse_split` (which also divides by m) but omitted the compensating ×m scale. Fix: in `execute_fast_type2_1d`, deconv values are packed into `ComplexPod` with `oversampled_len as f32` scaling before the GPU grid-load pass, so the normalized IFFT output equals the unnormalized IDFT without adding a second host-side deconv vector. The 3D path is unaffected: both CPU and GPU 3D type-2 paths use the normalized IDFT directly without rescaling, so they agree.

### Extension Phase

- Added `supports_mixed_precision` and `default_precision_profile` fields to all WGPU capability structs.
- Added NTT-WGPU exact quantized `u32` residue storage APIs that preserve modular values losslessly under the existing `u32::MAX` modulus bound and reject output shape mismatches.

- Added value-semantic typed verification tests for NUFFT 1D and 3D across Complex64, Complex32, and [f16;2] storage profiles with profile mismatch rejection.

## Remaining Gaps

Open gaps are listed at the top of this audit. Future increments should:
- Run the Criterion buffer-reuse benches on representative GPU hardware and record measured allocation-vs-reuse speedup ratios for 1D and 3D NUFFT fast paths.
- Verify `GpuFft3dF16Native` Bluestein path on production hardware with non-power-of-two sizes (current test passes on dev hardware; production validation is pending).


### Closed in this sprint (Performance & Native GPU Precision phase)

- Performance-quantification gap: added Criterion bench targets `buffer_reuse` to both `apollo-nufft-wgpu` (fast Type-1/Type-2 1D, per-call vs `with_buffers`, N=64/128/256) and `apollo-fft-wgpu` (3D forward/inverse, per-call vs `with_buffers`, nx=ny=nz=4/8/16).
- `NufftWgpuBackend` façade gap: added public `execute_fast_type1_1d_with_buffers`, `execute_fast_type2_1d_with_buffers`, `execute_fast_type1_3d_with_buffers`, `execute_fast_type2_3d_with_buffers` methods delegating to `NufftGpuKernel`.
- Native f16 GPU compute gap: added `GpuFft3dF16Native` behind `apollo-fft-wgpu/native-f16` feature; WGSL shaders `fft_native_f16.wgsl` and `pack_native_f16.wgsl` use `enable f16;` and `array<f16>` storage; host boundary performs f32↔f16 conversion; parity test verifies |error| < 5×10⁻³ against f32 GPU reference (O(log N)·ε_f16 bound with N=4).
- Bluestein f16 gap: implemented `chirp_native_f16.wgsl` with `enable f16;`, `array<f16>` bindings, and f32-precision twiddles narrowed to f16; lifted power-of-two-only constraint on `GpuFft3dF16Native` by adding `strategy_x/y/z`, `chirp_x/y/z` fields, `build_chirp_data_f16`, and `dispatch_chirp_f16` (flat 1D dispatch, no data races); roundtrip test on 3×3×3 (all-Bluestein) passes with error < 0.05.
- 3D NUFFT buffer-reuse bench gap: added `bench_fast_type1_3d` and `bench_fast_type2_3d` Criterion functions to `apollo-nufft-wgpu/benches/buffer_reuse.rs`; covers per-call vs `with_buffers` for N=4,6,8.
- Published-reference fixture breadth gap: added NTT impulse ([1,0,0,0]→[1,1,1,1], Pollard 1971), NTT constant ([1,1,1,1]→[4,0,0,0], geometric-series theorem), and NUFFT Type-1 at origin (single source x=0 → F[k]=1 ∀k, Dutt and Rokhlin 1993) to `apollo-validation`; all three verified at PUBLISHED_FIXTURE_LIMIT=1×10⁻¹².
