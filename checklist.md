# Apollo Checklist
## Closure CVX - Rader Generator-Order Cache Compression [patch]
Sprint target version: apollo-fft 0.12.24

- [x] Replace cached runtime Rader gather/scatter permutation pairs with one
  cached generator-order table keyed by `(N, g)`.
- [x] Derive scatter indices from the retained generator order by the exact
  cyclic-group identity `g^{-q} = g^(N-1-q)`.
- [x] Update standalone runtime Rader, half-cyclic runtime Rader, ordered-Rader
  Good-Thomas PFA, and two-by-prime ordered-Rader call sites.
- [x] Add value-semantic coverage proving derived inverse order matches the
  modular-inverse power sequence for every primitive-root table entry.
- [x] Verify feature compile, focused Rader tests, focused Good-Thomas tests,
  `xtask` compile, and focused half-cyclic Criterion timings.

## Closure CVIX - Half-Cyclic Rader Spectrum Memory Build [patch]
Sprint target version: apollo-fft 0.12.24

- [x] Remove the full length `N-1` temporary kernel from half-cyclic Rader
  spectrum construction.
- [x] Stream lower kernel values into the cyclic residue buffer, then combine
  upper kernel values directly into cyclic and twisted negacyclic residues.
- [x] Preserve the exact CRT residue definitions:
  `cyc[j] = kernel[j] + kernel[j+m]` and
  `neg[j] = (kernel[j] - kernel[j+m]) * exp(i*pi*j/m)`.
- [x] Verify feature compile, focused half-cyclic/full-cyclic equivalence, full
  Rader-filtered tests, `xtask` compile, and focused half-cyclic Criterion
  timings.

## Closure CVIII - Half-Cyclic Rader Strategy [patch]
Sprint target version: apollo-fft 0.12.24

- [x] Extract the half-cyclic convolution rule from Liu/Tolimieri ICASSP 1991
  and map it to Rader's length `N-1` cyclic convolution through
  `x^(2m)-1 = (x^m-1)(x^m+1)`.
- [x] Add the half-cyclic Winograd/Nussbaumer CRT split as a selectable Rader
  convolution strategy without adding a Bluestein compatibility route.
- [x] Keep one production Rader entry point; expose forced full-cyclic and
  half-cyclic strategy hooks only under test/debug/benchmark configuration.
- [x] Move automatic routing to a conservative shared threshold:
  `N-1 >= 1024` for f64 and f32.
- [x] Add value-semantic tests comparing automatic Rader, forced half-cyclic
  Rader, forced full-cyclic Rader, and direct DFT at N=521; retain the N=10007
  roundtrip with debug stack-safe dispatch.
- [x] Add `half_cyclic_rader` Criterion coverage for full-cyclic,
  half-cyclic, and automatic strategy timings at N=257/N=521/N=1031.
- [x] Verify `apollo-fft` feature compile, `xtask` compile, Rader tests, and
  focused benchmark execution. Default bench-quick O3 codegen was terminated
  locally; the completed optimized timing run used opt-level 1.

## Closure CVII - Fixed Good-Thomas Macro Dispatch Review [patch]
Sprint target version: apollo-fft 0.12.24

- [x] Review benchmark-comment disparities without treating monomorphization as
  evidence that different factorizations should execute the same arithmetic
  kernel.
- [x] Promote fixed coprime Good-Thomas dispatch into
  `generate_good_thomas_dispatch!` so canonical coprime pairs up to N=200 are
  generated from `short_sizes` and `max_n`, not hand-maintained match arms.
- [x] Route fixed coprime pairs through one bounded const-generic PFA codelet
  body with compile-time `(N1, N2, N, INVERSE)` parameters and const CRT maps.
- [x] Complete the proc-macro short-codelet refactor by restoring
  `generate_winograd_fft!`, removing the `ShortWinogradScalar`/`ShortDft`
  trait cycle, and routing generated Good-Thomas row/column transforms through
  direct `ShortDft<N>` calls.
- [x] Replace the Criterion-dependent targeted table path with an optimized
  `xtask` bounded adaptive runner; the full canonical table now regenerates in
  65.6 seconds from the already-built optimized `xtask` binary.
- [x] Optimize the shared odd-prime-pair DFT kernel by replacing iterator-zip
  arithmetic with const-indexed loops and native `one()` sign selection.
- [x] Reject all-shape unrolled per-pair body emission for this increment:
  the prototype passed value checks but exceeded the bounded bench/release
  compile budget, so the retained path is the bounded generic dispatcher.
- [x] Complete stale const-direction Rader/Bluestein call sites exposed by the
  focused rebuild.
- [x] Regenerate targeted quick-profile `benchmark_results.md` rows for
  N=84/N=90/N=94/N=150/N=175.
- [x] Refresh the N=10 precision-disparity row and verify the prior f32
  160.27 ns Apollo value was stale Criterion data.
- [x] Change `xtask benchmark --sizes ...` to merge only requested rows into
  the existing markdown table and require fresh requested Criterion estimates
  after non-`--skip-run` subset runs.
- [x] Refresh the N=77 precision-disparity row and verify the prior f32
  4.739x ratio was stale mixed-epoch Criterion data.
- [x] Refresh the full canonical `benchmark_results.md` table with the
  optimized `xtask` runner after the odd-prime-pair DFT11 improvement; current
  N=77 is 199.94 ns Apollo vs 103.96 ns RustFFT for f64 and 235.34 ns Apollo
  vs 78.52 ns RustFFT for f32.
- [x] Verify proc-macro compile, `apollo-fft` lib compile, bench compile,
  generated composite direct-DFT coverage, and fixed coprime direct-DFT
  coverage.
- [x] Probe N=44 after fixed PFA routing without rewriting
  `benchmark_results.md`; Apollo improved but still trailed RustFFT at
  1.541x f64 and 1.593x f32.

## Closure CVI - Short Good-Thomas Codelets and PFA Scratch Reuse [patch]
Sprint target version: apollo-fft 0.12.23

- [x] Reject benchmark table fabrication: `benchmark_results.md` remains
  measured Criterion evidence, not an editable success surface.
- [x] Add generated short Good-Thomas codelets for N=18, N=24, and N=36 from
  existing short factors instead of hand-written kernels.
- [x] Route the new codelets through the canonical short-Winograd dispatch
  surface for both forward and inverse execution.
- [x] Move generic natural/ordered PFA column storage from per-call `Vec`
  allocation into the existing thread-local PFA scratch buffer.
- [x] Move generated direct `2*p` natural-prime dispatch to a twiddle-free
  Good-Thomas row/column codelet for the promoted-prime family while retaining
  the previous Cooley-Tukey helper for comparison until a RustFFT-beating
  replacement is proven across the family.
- [x] Reduce benchmark loop latency by making `xtask benchmark` default to a
  quick Criterion profile and optimized `bench-quick` Cargo profile; retain
  `--profile full` for release-quality timing.
- [x] Probe broader generated fixed coprime dispatch and reject it for this
  increment because optimized ThinLTO release builds became unstable under the
  repository's current codegen profile.
- [x] Verify `apollo-fft-macros` compile, `apollo-fft` lib compile, and
  direct-DFT value coverage for N=18/N=24/N=36. Full Criterion regeneration
  remains pending because bounded `vs_rustfft` release bench builds did not
  produce usable timing output in this turn.
- [x] Verify focused two-by-prime correctness, `xtask` compile, benchmark
  harness compile, quick-profile `xtask benchmark --sizes 38`, and
  quick-profile `xtask benchmark --sizes 58,74,82,94`.

## Closure CV - Natural Good-Thomas and Generated Codelet Dispatch [patch]
Sprint target version: apollo-fft 0.12.22

- [x] Bind the natural PFA output scatter to the cached CRT table contract:
  `output_perm[k2 * n1 + k1]` maps transformed `(k1, k2)` columns to natural
  frequency order.
- [x] Add value-semantic direct-DFT forward coverage for a nontrivial coprime
  natural PFA shape.
- [x] Add value-semantic direct-DFT unnormalized inverse coverage for the same
  natural PFA shape.
- [x] Complete stale Winograd const-generic direction call sites exposed by a
  fresh rebuild, including generator output, production short-codelet dispatch,
  and unit tests.
- [x] Move generated `3*p` Good-Thomas bodies to direct const-generic DFT-3
  column codelets and direct row codelets from one macro prime list.
- [x] Keep the short-Winograd surface compact around authoritative
  const-generic leaves and prime-pair table traits; no retained Rader,
  Good-Thomas, Winograd, butterfly, Stockham, or four-step component was
  removed.
- [x] Extend the canonical `vs_rustfft` f64/f32 Criterion table with
  N=38/58/74/82/94 and regenerate `benchmark_results.md` after targeted
  refreshes for N=33/38/58/74/82/94.
- [x] Add `xtask benchmark` as the only active benchmark runner/table
  generator for `benchmark_results.md`.
- [x] Remove redundant benchmark workflow artifacts: `extract_benchmarks.py`,
  `quick_compare`, duplicate validation `vs_rustfft`, and bench output logs.
- [x] Bump `apollo-fft` to 0.12.22 and update CHANGELOG.md, backlog.md,
  gap_audit.md, and checklist.md.
- [x] Verify focused natural PFA tests, focused Good-Thomas tests, full
  `apollo-fft` library tests, focused Winograd large/composite tests,
  `apollo-fft-macros` compile, `apollo-fft` bench/example compile, targeted
  Criterion rows, `xtask benchmark --skip-run`, and diff hygiene.

## Closure CIV - Generated Good-Thomas Family Dispatch [patch]
Sprint target version: apollo-fft 0.12.21

- [x] Change `generate_three_by_prime_dispatch!` from generated
  gather/scatter closures plus a runtime driver to generated full-body
  per-prime `3*p` Good-Thomas kernels.
- [x] Add `generate_two_by_prime_natural_dispatch!` and replace the local
  `macro_rules!` Winograd-pair `2*p` dispatch table with a proc-macro table.
- [x] Promote prime-pair table availability into the sealed Winograd scalar
  contract so generated dispatch compiles in release with one scalar bound.
- [x] Preserve the retained hand DFT-3 codelet as the selected implementation;
  the current generated Winograd direct-DFT prototype is not promoted over it.
- [x] Regenerate `benchmark_results.md`; N=33 records f64 94.34 ns vs RustFFT
  68.16 ns and f32 108.75 ns vs RustFFT 64.81 ns.
- [x] Verify proc-macro compile, lib compile, focused two-by-prime and
  three-by-prime correctness, generated Rader correctness, bench/example
  feature compile, release quick comparison, targeted N=33 Criterion refresh,
  benchmark extraction, and extractor syntax validation.

## Closure CIII - Generated Good-Thomas Route Fusion [patch]
Sprint target version: apollo-fft 0.12.20

- [x] Extend `generate_three_by_prime_dispatch!` so the generator emits the
  per-prime CRT gather and scatter functions, not only the support predicate
  and dispatch table.
- [x] Replace runtime `ThreeByPrimePlan` hot-path loads/stores with generated
  literal route stores while retaining the verified const-plan tests.
- [x] Add `short_winograd_const` so generated Good-Thomas routes use
  const-size short-codelet dispatch and compile-time inverse selection.
- [x] Repair generated Rader mapping, twiddle precision, and inverse symbol
  scope; bound static Rader generation to 5/7/11/13 until a scalable generated
  convolution backend exists.
- [x] Regenerate `benchmark_results.md`; N=33 records f64 93.00 ns vs RustFFT
  64.92 ns and f32 108.00 ns vs RustFFT 67.49 ns.
- [x] Verify proc-macro compile, lib compile, focused three-by-prime
  correctness, generated Rader correctness, bench/example feature compile,
  benchmark extraction, and extractor syntax validation. Release quick-compare
  rebuild exceeded the 300-second cap.

## Closure CII - Good-Thomas Proc-Macro Dispatch Generator [patch]
Sprint target version: apollo-fft 0.12.19

- [x] Read `gengoodthomas.md`, `genpermute.md`, `genrader.md`, and
  `genwinograd.md`; select the duplicated Good-Thomas `3*p` support/match
  surface as the next safe proc-macro increment.
- [x] Add the internal `apollo-fft-macros` proc-macro crate with
  `generate_three_by_prime_dispatch!`.
- [x] Replace hand-written `3*p` support detection and `(P, inverse)` match
  arms with generated code from one short-prime list.
- [x] Preserve the generic `three_by_prime_impl` runtime kernel,
  `ThreeByPrimePlan<const P>`, static dispatch, and all retained FFT
  components.
- [x] Regenerate `benchmark_results.md`; N=33 still records f64 101.49 ns vs
  RustFFT 70.27 ns and f32 121.28 ns vs RustFFT 78.91 ns.
- [x] Verify proc-macro compile, lib compile, focused three-by-prime
  correctness, bench/example feature compile, release quick timing,
  benchmark extraction, extractor syntax validation, and diff hygiene.

## Closure CI - Good-Thomas Const CRT Plan [patch]
Sprint target version: apollo-fft 0.12.18

- [x] Read `gengoodthomas.md`, `genpermute.md`, `genrader.md`, and
  `genwinograd.md`; select the stable const-plan Good-Thomas layer as the next
  verifiable increment before adding a proc-macro crate.
- [x] Replace runtime modular inverse/CRT output-stride calculation in the
  compact `3*p` route with `ThreeByPrimePlan<const P>`.
- [x] Verify compile-time input/output CRT maps against the Good-Thomas
  formula for P=5/7/11/13/17/23.
- [x] Preserve the monomorphized `MixedRadixScalar` route and all retained FFT
  components; no size-specific branch was introduced.
- [x] Regenerate `benchmark_results.md`; N=33 now records f64 101.49 ns vs
  RustFFT 70.27 ns and f32 121.28 ns vs RustFFT 78.91 ns.
- [x] Verify lib compile, bench/example feature compile, focused
  three-by-prime correctness, quick release timing, targeted Criterion rows,
  benchmark extraction, extractor syntax validation, and diff hygiene.

## Closure C - Three-By-Prime Good-Thomas Routing [patch]
Sprint target version: apollo-fft 0.12.17

- [x] Identify N=33 route pathology: dispatcher selected the prime-23
  mixed-radix composite `[11, 3]` path before the twiddle-free coprime
  Good-Thomas route.
- [x] Add a compact Good-Thomas `3*p` CRT codelet for supported short prime
  factors 5/7/11/13/17/23.
- [x] Route only the verified compact `3*p` family ahead of
  `cached_prime23_radices`, preserving all existing retained kernels and
  avoiding unmeasured early-dispatch changes for `2*p`.
- [x] Restore the benchmark-only ordered-Rader hooks to the current
  `rader_ordered_impl` API.
- [x] Regenerate `benchmark_results.md`; N=33 now records f64 104.08 ns vs
  RustFFT 69.15 ns and f32 128.21 ns vs RustFFT 63.15 ns.
- [x] Verify focused f64/f32 direct-DFT equivalence, lib compile, bench/example
  feature compile, quick release comparison, targeted N=33 Criterion timing,
  benchmark extraction, and extractor syntax validation.

## Closure XCIX - Typed Real-Storage Direct Fill [patch]
Sprint target version: apollo-fft 0.12.16

- [x] Replace f64/f32/f16 typed `forward_1d_into`, `forward_2d_into`, and
  `forward_3d_into` mapped-temporary assignment with direct caller-buffer
  real-to-complex fills.
- [x] Replace f64/f32/f16 typed `inverse_1d_into`, `inverse_2d_into`, and
  `inverse_3d_into` mapped-temporary real extraction with direct scratch-to-real
  fills.
- [x] Remove the extra complex clone from allocating typed 1D/2D/3D forward
  paths by transforming the mapped output in place.
- [x] Keep compact f16 conversion explicit at the storage boundary and keep the
  f32 plan family as the execution scalar.
- [x] Bump `apollo-fft` to 0.12.16 and update CHANGELOG.md, backlog.md,
  gap_audit.md, checklist.md, and benchmark_results.md.
- [x] Verify `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`, `cargo check -p apollo-fft
  --benches --examples --features kernel-strategy-bench`, focused
  power-of-two tests, f64/f32/f16 typed API coverage, benchmark extraction, and
  extractor syntax validation.
- [x] Re-run the public six-step zero-allocation Criterion row after the active
  workspace `cargo bench --no-run` process finishes; N=5120 records 11.530 us
  mean and no allocation assertion failure.

## Closure XCVIII - Generic Plan Cache Scalar Routing [patch]
Sprint target version: apollo-fft 0.12.15

- [x] Resolve typed real FFT plan precision through `RealFftData::PlanScalar`
  and `PlanCacheProvider`, keeping f64/f32 native caches and routing compact
  f16 storage through f32 plans at the storage boundary.
- [x] Keep 1D/2D/3D plan execution monomorphized over `MixedRadixScalar`
  without adding dynamic dispatch or cloned f32/f64 API families.
- [x] Retune the restored power-of-two fast-path cutoff to N>=64 so N=16 and
  N=32 remain on the faster current short-codelet path while the generic route
  continues to cover larger powers without deleting retained components.
- [x] Update typed helper call sites, CPU transport tests, and benchmark paths
  to use the cache-provider and real-storage contracts directly.
- [x] Bump `apollo-fft` to 0.12.15 and update CHANGELOG.md, backlog.md,
  gap_audit.md, checklist.md, and benchmark_results.md.
- [x] Verify `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`, `cargo check -p apollo-fft
  --benches --examples --features kernel-strategy-bench`, focused
  power-of-two tests, f64/f32/f16 typed API coverage, quick comparison for
  N=16/N=32/N=64/N=128, benchmark extraction, and extractor syntax validation.
- [x] Attempt targeted Criterion refresh for N=16 after the pre-existing bench
  writer finishes; record the 300-second timeout as an unresolved benchmark
  harness/runtime gap rather than replacing the canonical table with quick-run
  numbers.
- [ ] Run fresh targeted Criterion rows for N=16, N=32, N=64, N=128, and
  N=32768 after the N=16 targeted Criterion timeout is resolved.

## Closure XCVII - Power-of-Two Fast-Path Restoration [patch]
Sprint target version: apollo-fft 0.12.14

- [x] Route power-of-two lengths N>=16 through one generic fast-path before
  small Winograd, composite, PFA, or Rader routing.
- [x] Keep N=2, N=4, and N=8 on short Winograd codelets while preserving all
  retained Rader, Good-Thomas, Winograd, butterfly, Stockham, and four-step
  implementations.
- [x] Select square four-step only for even-exponent lengths above the
  four-step threshold; use Stockham for asymmetric power-of-two lengths such as
  N=8192 and N=32768.
- [x] Add a value-semantic N=32768 forward DC regression test that rejects the
  selector no-op failure mode hidden by forward+inverse roundtrips.
- [x] Restore manifest consistency for current verification by adding the
  workspace `tokio` dependency and the `kernel-strategy-bench` feature.
- [x] Restore the 1D generic caller-owned typed forward/inverse methods used by
  zero-allocation benchmark paths.
- [x] Bump `apollo-fft` to 0.12.14 and update CHANGELOG.md, backlog.md,
  gap_audit.md, checklist.md, and benchmark_results.md.
- [x] Verify focused power-of-two correctness tests, `cargo check -p
  apollo-fft --lib`, `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples
  --features kernel-strategy-bench`, and benchmark extraction.
- [ ] Run fresh targeted Criterion rows for N=16, N=32, N=64, N=128, and
  N=32768 after the two pre-existing Criterion writer processes finish.

## Closure XCVI - Small Good-Thomas Codelet Restoration [patch]
Sprint target version: apollo-fft 0.12.13

- [x] Add stack-resident CRT Good-Thomas codelets for N=6, N=10, N=12, and
  N=14 using existing DFT-3/4/5/7 Winograd leaves.
- [x] Route the monomorphized `short_winograd` dispatcher through the new
  codelets before mixed-radix, PFA, or Rader routing can allocate scratch or
  fetch twiddle/permutation caches for those small composites.
- [x] Preserve all retained Rader, Good-Thomas, Winograd, butterfly, and
  composite routes; no component is removed before a measured replacement
  beats RustFFT.
- [x] Remove the private obsolete Good-Thomas gather helper left unused by the
  fused ordered-Rader PFA path, resolving the bench build warning at source.
- [x] Bump `apollo-fft` to 0.12.13 and update CHANGELOG.md, backlog.md,
  gap_audit.md, checklist.md, and benchmark_results.md.
- [x] Verify direct-value small-composite tests, mixed forward dispatch tests,
  and `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`.
- [x] Run targeted `vs_rustfft` Criterion rows for N=6, N=10, N=12, and N=14
  and regenerate `benchmark_results.md` from the updated cache.

## Closure XCV - Rader Negacyclic Twist/Recombine Fusion [patch]
Sprint target version: apollo-fft 0.12.12

- [x] Fuse Rader negacyclic twist multiplication into the Nussbaumer split
  pass for every large-prime Rader route using negacyclic convolution.
- [x] Fuse conjugate untwist multiplication into CRT recombination, removing
  the standalone untwist pass over the negacyclic half.
- [x] Preserve the fused radix-composite forward-plus-pointwise Rader
  convolution path and keep all retained Rader, Good-Thomas, Winograd,
  butterfly, and composite routes available.
- [x] Bump `apollo-fft` to 0.12.12 and update CHANGELOG.md, backlog.md,
  gap_audit.md, checklist.md, and benchmark_results.md.
- [x] Verify `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`,
  `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples --features kernel-strategy-bench`,
  focused Rader/prime-dispatch tests, benchmark extraction, and extractor
  syntax validation.

## Closure XCIV - Interleaved Two-Prime and Rader Pointwise Fusion [patch]
Sprint target version: apollo-fft 0.12.11

- [x] Remove the direct `2*p` promoted-prime even-half stack copy and odd-half
  compaction by letting the monomorphized Winograd-pair two-prime kernel read
  interleaved even/odd input directly.
- [x] Keep direct two-by-prime routing generic over the existing
  `PrimePairTable<P, H>` const-generic family; no per-size route was removed.
- [x] Implement the f32/f64 `MixedRadixScalar::composite_forward_with_pointwise`
  contract so Rader circular and negacyclic convolution can use fused
  radix-composite forward-plus-spectrum multiplication.
- [x] Preserve all Rader, Good-Thomas, Winograd, butterfly, and composite
  routes; retained components stay available until a measured replacement
  beats RustFFT.
- [x] Bump `apollo-fft` to 0.12.11 and update CHANGELOG.md, backlog.md,
  gap_audit.md, checklist.md, and benchmark_results.md.
- [x] Verify compile/test surface with focused two-by-prime, Good-Thomas,
  Rader, prime-dispatch, radix-composite, bench/example compile checks,
  benchmark extraction, and Python extractor syntax validation.
- [x] Regenerate the canonical Apollo-vs-RustFFT f64/f32 table from the current
  Criterion cache snapshot. A full workspace bench process was already active
  during this cycle and continued updating Criterion rows.

## Closure XCIII - Fused Routing and Good-Thomas Permutation Tightening [patch]
Sprint target version: apollo-fft 0.12.10

- [x] Route fused radix-composite scalar stage output traversal through
  `chunks_exact_mut(stage_chunk)`, preserving const-radix monomorphized stage
  bodies while removing repeated block slice-bound recomputation.
- [x] Convert fused radix-composite final pointwise spectrum multiplication to
  raw pointer traversal over the contiguous output block under the existing
  length contract.
- [x] Tighten Good-Thomas natural and ordered-Rader PFA gather/scatter loops
  with cached-permutation length assertions and four-wide unchecked copies.
- [x] Fix the retained Winograd N=82 composite codelet bound with
  `PrimePairTable<41, 20>` instead of removing the route.
- [x] Retain all Rader, Good-Thomas, Winograd, butterfly, and composite routes;
  no component is removed before a measured RustFFT-beating replacement exists.
- [x] Bump `apollo-fft` to 0.12.10 and update CHANGELOG.md, backlog.md,
  gap_audit.md, checklist.md, and benchmark_results.md.
- [x] Verify `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`, focused
  radix-composite/Good-Thomas/mixed-radix unit tests, bench/example compile
  coverage, debug quick strategy/public comparisons, benchmark extraction, and
  `git diff --check`. `cargo fmt --check --package apollo-fft` remains blocked
  by broader worktree formatting drift outside this increment.

## Closure XCII - Radix-Composite Stage Dispatch and Benchmark Snapshot [patch]
Sprint target version: apollo-fft 0.12.9

- [x] Move recursive fused-composite scratch arena and adaptive recursion into
  `radix_composite/adaptive.rs`, reducing `radix_composite/arity.rs` from 544
  lines to 421 lines while preserving the existing fused-stage contract.
- [x] Add a flat Stockham scalar stage dispatcher that monomorphizes by radix
  at the stage boundary and removes the per-output-group runtime radix match.
- [x] Route `flat_stockham_fused` through the stage dispatcher for all scalar
  fallback radices while keeping the existing f64 AVX2 radix-3/radix-4 stage
  hooks.
- [x] Collapse fused radix-composite final pointwise spectrum multiplication to
  one contiguous pass over the output block for all radices.
- [x] Restore Rader benchmark routing through the shared generic Rader kernel
  and real Winograd-pair kernels, update deleted-module test references, and
  keep static per-prime permutation tables compile-time generated on stable
  Rust.
- [x] Retain Winograd composite large leaves while restoring value-semantic
  composite test resolution; no composite component is gated or removed before
  a measured RustFFT-beating replacement exists.
- [x] Regenerate `benchmark_results.md` from all Criterion
  `target/criterion/**/new/estimates.json` records and the latest debug
  Rader-vs-Winograd-pair quick strategy comparison.
- [x] Bump `apollo-fft` to 0.12.9 and update CHANGELOG.md, backlog.md,
  gap_audit.md, and checklist.md.
- [x] Verify with `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`,
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib radix_composite -- --test-threads=1`, and
  `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples --features kernel-strategy-bench`.
  `cargo fmt --check --package apollo-fft` remains blocked by pre-existing
  formatting drift outside this increment. Release `quick_compare` timing was
  not regenerated because concurrent Cargo/rustc workloads caused release
  example compilation to exceed the command cap and previously hit LLVM memory
  exhaustion.

## Closure XCI - Rader Bluestein Cache/Vector Hook Optimization [patch]
Sprint target version: apollo-fft 0.12.8

- [x] Replace cached inverse Bluestein spectrum retention with conjugated
  forward-spectrum multiplication derived from the even-kernel identity.
- [x] Wire Rader Bluestein pre-chirp/zero-pad and post-chirp/scaling through
  the precision-specific SIMD hook surface.
- [x] Extend pointwise SIMD multiplication to support conjugated right-hand
  operands so inverse Bluestein remains vectorized without a second cached
  spectrum.
- [x] Correct typed-pointer `write_bytes` lane counts in the Bluestein SIMD
  zero-fill path.
- [x] Bump `apollo-fft` to 0.12.8 and update CHANGELOG.md, backlog.md, and
  gap_audit.md.
- [x] Verify with `cargo fmt --check --package apollo-fft`,
  `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`,
  `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples --features kernel-strategy-bench`,
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib rader -- --test-threads=1`,
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib mixed_forward_prime -- --test-threads=1`,
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib mixed_inverse_prime -- --test-threads=1`,
  and `git diff --check`. Focused release `quick_compare` remained blocked by
  active external Apollo `cargo bench` work in the shared release target.

## Closure XC - Rader Standalone Memory-Pass Optimization [patch]
Sprint target version: apollo-fft 0.12.7

- [x] Fuse standalone Rader primitive-root gather with the nonzero DC sum so
  `sum_x = Σ_q x[g^q]` is computed in the same pass that fills the convolution
  buffer.
- [x] Apply the same fused path to generated static-table Rader leaves and the
  runtime permutation-cache Rader fallback.
- [x] Unroll static-table and runtime scatter loops while preserving the
  `X[g_inv^q] -> natural index` permutation contract.
- [x] Replace retained two-buffer Rader scratch pools with one retained aligned
  thread-local buffer per precision plus local nested-call fallback.
- [x] Bump `apollo-fft` to 0.12.7 and update CHANGELOG.md, backlog.md, and
  gap_audit.md.
- [x] Verify with `cargo fmt --package apollo-fft`,
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib rader -- --test-threads=1`,
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib mixed_forward_prime -- --test-threads=1`,
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib mixed_inverse_prime -- --test-threads=1`,
  `cargo check -p apollo-fft`,
  `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples --features kernel-strategy-bench`,
  release strategy-only `quick_compare`, and `git diff --check`.

## Closure LXXXIX - Fused Radix-Composite Dispatch Repair [patch]
Sprint target version: apollo-fft 0.12.6

- [x] Keep `factorize_composite` prime-only and lower consecutive radix-2 pairs
  to radix-4 stages at dispatch time, preserving the product invariant while
  avoiding unsupported higher-power radix emission.
- [x] Extend radix-composite runtime and ZST dispatch to radix 4, 8, 17, and
  23 so lowered tails and direct prime leaves share the same static arity path.
- [x] Add recursive arena scratch accounting for nested fused `Compose` stages;
  capacity is reserved before live midpoint pointers are exposed.
- [x] Reconnect `stockham_stage_fused` to the `FusedStage` ZST arity family and
  `ExecutionPolicy` static chunk dispatch.
- [x] Correct fused-stage twiddle slice extents so each stage receives
  `(radix - 1) * prev_len * prior_product` coefficients instead of an
  over-wide slice.
- [x] Keep the incomplete `radix_composite::tiling` placeholder out of the
  compiled module graph while preserving the authoritative fused core path.
- [x] Preserve direct N=17/N=23 Winograd dispatch and restore trait coverage for
  short prime leaves required by composite and Rader paths.
- [x] Retain Rader-vs-Winograd-pair comparison hooks and add direct
  equivalence tests before any strategy removal.
- [x] Add a gated Criterion comparison group for Rader vs Winograd-pair kernels
  at N=29/N=31/N=37 for f64 and f32.
- [x] Compare Rader vs Winograd-pair with bounded `quick_compare` debug probe:
  Winograd-pair ratios were 0.151/0.432 at N=29, 0.493/0.967 at N=31,
  and 0.269/0.736 at N=37 for f64/f32 respectively.
- [x] Route production N=29/N=31/N=37 dispatch through the no-gather
  Winograd-pair kernels; keep generated Rader available for larger primes and
  gated strategy comparison.
- [x] Consolidate generated Rader prime leaves N=17..97 behind
  `rader_static_impl::<F, N, G, G_INV>` so generator-specific routing remains
  const-generic and monomorphized instead of cloned PFA bodies.
- [x] Fuse Rader static gather with x0 accumulation and scatter with x0 offset;
  route convolution through final-forward-stage composite pointwise fusion when
  N-1 has cached radix-composite factors.
- [x] Remove stale composite dispatch code: unused `radix_composite::butterfly`,
  unused `dispatch_inplace_with_scratch`, and unused `FusedStage` associated
  items.
- [x] Add dispatch-level forward/inverse direct-DFT checks for N=29/N=31/N=37.
- [x] Add generated Rader direct-DFT regression coverage for every generated
  prime leaf from N=17 through N=97.
- [x] Closure XCII supersedes the earlier composite export narrowing: retained
  large Winograd leaves remain available until a measured replacement beats
  RustFFT.
- [x] Correct radix-4 lowering tests to assert pair-only promotion and the
  identity `192 = 3 * 4^3`.
- [x] Repair the radix-2 lowering implementation after the rejected
  highest-power lowering probe emitted unsupported radix 16.
- [x] Verified with `cargo fmt --check`,
  `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches --examples`,
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] Re-run bounded strategy probe after Rader fusion and lowering repair:
  debug Winograd/Rader ratios are 0.345/0.541 at N=29, 0.309/0.710 at N=31,
  and 0.414/0.883 at N=37 for f64/f32 respectively after static Rader
  permutation-table leaves; Rader still does not replace Winograd-pair for
  these small primes.
- [x] Record release production `quick_compare` against RustFFT: N=29 Apollo
  0.096 us vs RustFFT 0.107 us, N=31 0.104 us vs 0.105 us, and N=37 0.147 us
  vs 0.132 us.
- [x] Record release strategy-only Rader-vs-Winograd-pair `quick_compare`:
  Winograd/Rader ratios are 0.206/0.476 at N=29, 0.368/0.566 at N=31, and
  0.334/0.555 at N=37 for f64/f32 respectively.
- [x] Add static permutation-table Rader leaves for N=29/N=31/N=37 through
  `rader_static_table_impl::<F, N, L, G_INV>`, eliminating runtime modular
  gather/scatter index recurrence while preserving the true Rader convolution
  and final-forward-stage pointwise fusion.
- [x] Add ordered-layout Rader static/runtime kernels for fused callers: input
  tails use `x[g^q]`, output tails use `X[g_inv^q]`, and `data[1..]` is reused
  as the convolution buffer so standalone Rader gather/scatter and scratch copy
  are absent under that layout contract.
- [x] Add direct-DFT value tests for ordered Rader N=29 forward, N=31 inverse,
  and N=37 runtime forward.
- [x] Wire ordered-layout Rader into Good-Thomas PFA for prime `n1` dimensions
  that would otherwise use Rader, folding generator-order input into the
  transpose and inverse-generator output into the final CRT scatter.
- [x] Reuse the Rader permutation cache in the ordered-Rader PFA branch so
  transpose and CRT scatter consume cached generator/inverse-generator order
  arrays instead of recomputing modular index walks at runtime.
- [x] Add direct-DFT PFA coverage for N=38 forward and N=82 inverse, plus
  branch-selection coverage that excludes N=29/N=31/N=37 from ordered Rader so
  the measured Winograd-pair production choice remains intact.
- [x] Route ordered-Rader PFA through the known-prime monomorphized ordered
  Rader dispatcher before the runtime fallback.
- [x] Add `APOLLO_FFT_QUICK_N` to `quick_compare` and include ordered-Rader PFA
  composite sizes N=38/N=82/N=86/N=94/N=106 in the default probe set.
- [x] Add `ordered_rader_pfa_coprime_composites` to `prime_compose` for the
  same ordered-Rader PFA composite sizes.
- [x] Record release ordered-Rader PFA `quick_compare`: N=38 Apollo 0.624 us vs
  RustFFT 0.097 us (6.433x), N=82 0.862 us vs 0.334 us (2.581x), N=86
  1.022 us vs 0.408 us (2.505x), N=94 1.227 us vs 0.665 us (1.845x), and
  N=106 1.461 us vs 0.595 us (2.455x).
- [x] Add `good_thomas::two_by_prime` for N=2p composites, using direct
  Cooley-Tukey even/odd decomposition, cached `W_N^k` twiddles, and
  stack-resident static half buffers for promoted primes.
- [x] Promote N=19/N=41/N=43/N=47/N=53 from production Rader dispatch to the
  shared odd-prime Winograd-pair family while retaining Rader benchmark hooks.
- [x] Move odd-prime Winograd-pair code into `winograd/radix/odd_prime_pair.rs`;
  current line counts: `good_thomas/mod.rs` 267, `good_thomas/two_by_prime.rs`
  318, `winograd/radix.rs` 301, `winograd/radix/odd_prime_pair.rs` 381.
- [x] Expand `quick_compare`, `prime_compose`, and `kernel_strategy` coverage
  for promoted prime leaves and two-by-prime composites.
- [x] Remove the stale dedicated DFT-82 codelet and short-dispatch arm; N=82
  now falls through to the generic two-by-prime route and uses the promoted
  N=41 Winograd-pair half kernel.
- [x] Record release promoted-prime `quick_compare`: N=19 0.050 us vs
  RustFFT 0.051 us (0.980x), N=29 0.095 us vs 0.103 us (0.922x), N=31
  0.100 us vs 0.142 us (0.704x), N=37 0.149 us vs 0.156 us (0.955x), N=41
  0.173 us vs 0.172 us (1.006x), N=43 0.153 us vs 0.221 us (0.692x), N=47
  0.199 us vs 0.352 us (0.565x), and N=53 0.261 us vs 0.296 us (0.882x).
- [x] Record release two-by-prime `quick_compare`: N=38 0.192 us vs 0.099 us
  (1.939x), N=58 0.289 us vs 0.203 us (1.424x), N=62 0.279 us vs 0.226 us
  (1.235x), N=74 0.377 us vs 0.376 us (1.003x), N=82 0.429 us vs 0.350 us
  (1.226x), N=86 0.407 us vs 0.448 us (0.908x), N=94 0.511 us vs 0.753 us
  (0.679x), and N=106 0.618 us vs 0.647 us (0.955x).
- [x] Replace thread-local PFA scratch in the promoted direct N=2p route with a
  const-generic stack even-half load and in-place odd-half compaction before
  fused two-prime Winograd execution.
- [x] Record release promoted-prime warm `quick_compare` after stack compaction:
  N=19 0.049 us vs RustFFT 0.054 us (0.907x), N=29 0.103 us vs 0.106 us
  (0.972x), N=31 0.092 us vs 0.125 us (0.736x), N=37 0.131 us vs 0.164 us
  (0.799x), N=41 0.162 us vs 0.225 us (0.720x), N=43 0.169 us vs 0.282 us
  (0.599x), N=47 0.226 us vs 0.388 us (0.582x), and N=53 0.298 us vs
  0.328 us (0.909x).
- [x] Record release two-by-prime warm `quick_compare` after stack compaction:
  N=38 0.165 us vs RustFFT 0.109 us (1.514x), N=58 0.239 us vs 0.200 us
  (1.195x), N=62 0.248 us vs 0.202 us (1.228x), N=74 0.305 us vs 0.288 us
  (1.059x), N=82 0.363 us vs 0.354 us (1.025x), N=86 0.381 us vs 0.404 us
  (0.943x), N=94 0.440 us vs 0.749 us (0.587x), and N=106 0.516 us vs
  0.682 us (0.757x).
- [x] Remove the remaining `macro_rules!` composite Winograd test generator and
  replace it with a const-generic shared helper plus grouped explicit tests;
  `winograd/tests/dft_composite.rs` is 416 lines and preserves forward,
  inverse, roundtrip, DC, and f32-vs-f64 value checks for every covered size.
- [x] Retain only the bounded call-shape change with measured local benefit:
  keep N=29/N=31 Winograd-pair wrappers out-of-line and mark N=37
  Winograd-pair wrapper `#[inline(always)]`.
- [ ] Record fresh Criterion/RustFFT timing for the restored fused path; the
  bounded `APOLLO_FFT_BENCH_N=192` attempt exceeded 180 seconds before output.
- [ ] Record fresh Criterion Rader-vs-Winograd-pair timings; the filtered
  `kernel_strategy` run remains pending.

- [x] Add internal contiguous Complex64 slice entry points to `FrftPlan` so
  typed storage paths can call the canonical direct FrFT kernel without
  temporary `Array1` construction.
- [x] Replace per-call typed `Array1<Complex64>` input and output allocations
  with thread-local reusable Complex64 workspaces.
- [x] Add value-semantic regression coverage proving repeated `Complex32`
  typed calls reuse workspace capacity and preserve outputs.
- [x] Restore the current `apollo-fft` kernel module header needed by the FrFT
  dependency build.
- [x] Remove current `apollo-fft` dead helper warnings from f16 bridge,
  radix permutation, radix shape, and radix stage modules without reintroducing
  compatibility facades.
- [x] Bump `apollo-frft` to 0.1.2, bump `apollo-fft` to 0.2.1, and update
  `Cargo.lock`.
- [x] Verify with `cargo check -p apollo-frft`,
  `cargo test -p apollo-frft typed --lib -- --test-threads=1`,
  `cargo test -p apollo-frft --lib -- --test-threads=1`,
  `cargo check -p apollo-frft-wgpu -p apollo-validation`,
  `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`, focused radix-shape/radix-permutation
  tests, and source scans for removed typed bridge allocations plus deleted
  dead helper names.

## Closure XLII - Apollo-FRFT Unitary Workspace Reuse [patch]
Sprint target version: apollo-frft 0.1.1

- [x] Replace per-call `Vec<Complex64>` coefficient allocation in
  `UnitaryFrftPlan` with reusable thread-local scratch.
- [x] Preserve the three-step Candan-Grünbaum computation:
  `c = V^T x`, `c[k] *= exp(-i order k pi/2)`, `output = V c`.
- [x] Add value-semantic regression coverage proving repeated calls reuse the
  scratch capacity and produce identical outputs.
- [x] Remove stale backward-compatibility wording from live crate-root FrFT
  exports without deleting active public API.
- [x] Bump `apollo-frft` to 0.1.1 and update `Cargo.lock`.
- [x] Verify with `cargo check -p apollo-frft`,
  `cargo test -p apollo-frft unitary --lib -- --test-threads=1`,
  `cargo test -p apollo-frft --lib -- --test-threads=1`,
  `cargo check -p apollo-frft-wgpu -p apollo-validation`, and a source scan for
  stale compatibility/deprecated markers plus the removed allocation expression.

## Closure XLII - Apollo-FFT Compatibility Re-Export Cleanup [major]
Sprint target version: apollo-fft 0.2.0

- [x] Remove root `apollo_fft::{backend,error,plan,types}` compatibility
  modules and replace root exports with canonical re-exports from
  `application::execution::plan::fft`, `domain::contracts`, and
  `domain::metadata`.
- [x] Remove `apollo_fft::application::{plan,cache}` and
  `apollo_fft::domain::{backend,error,precision,shape}` compatibility modules.
- [x] Remove the legacy `FFT_CACHE` alias; retain explicit `FFT_CACHE_1D`,
  `FFT_CACHE_2D`, and `FFT_CACHE_3D` roots.
- [x] Delete unused
  `infrastructure::cpu::simd::power_of_two::{radix4,radix8}` forwarding modules
  that duplicated canonical radix-2 execution.
- [x] Update in-repo callers in `apollo-fft-wgpu`, `apollo-czt`,
  `apollo-nufft`, `apollo-stft`, and `apollo-sft` to use root or canonical
  paths.
- [x] Bump `apollo-fft` to 0.2.0 and update `Cargo.lock`.
- [x] Verify with `cargo check -p apollo-fft --lib`,
  `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches`, dependent-crate `cargo check`, full
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`, and source scans for
  removed compatibility paths.

## Closure XLII - STFT-WGPU Deprecated Error and Retained-Resource Cleanup [major]
Sprint target version: apollo-stft-wgpu 0.11.0

- [x] Remove `WgpuError::FrameLenNotPowerOfTwo` from the STFT-WGPU public error
  surface.
- [x] Update non-power-of-two STFT-WGPU tests to assert successful Chirp-Z
  forward, inverse, and reusable-buffer execution instead of checking only that
  a deprecated error is absent.
- [x] Replace explicit `#[allow(dead_code)]` retained GPU-resource fields in
  STFT-WGPU buffer and Chirp-Z resource holders with `_`-prefixed ownership
  fields.
- [x] Remove explicit `#[allow(dead_code)]` suppressions from NUFFT-WGPU reusable
  buffers by enforcing `max_samples` before GPU writes and adding value-semantic
  overflow tests for 1D and 3D buffer reuse.
- [x] Replace NUFFT-WGPU per-dispatch layout-placeholder buffers with one
  retained `layout_padding_buffer` shared across fast-path bind groups whose
  entry point does not read that binding.
- [x] Remove explicit `#[allow(dead_code)]` suppressions from NTT-WGPU reusable
  buffers by deleting duplicated scalar `n_inv` storage and renaming retained
  GPU resource-owner fields.
- [x] Remove `apollo-dctdst` DCT-II/DST-II fast-path unused sibling-output
  allocations by factoring the shared 2N-point FFT setup and projection fills.
- [x] Add DCT/DST fast-path regression coverage proving single DCT-II/DST-II
  projection outputs match the dual-projection kernel and direct analytical
  kernels.
- [x] Bump `apollo-dctdst` to 0.1.1 for the patch-class memory cleanup.
- [x] Bump `apollo-stft-wgpu` to 0.11.0 and document the pre-1.0 breaking
  cleanup in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- [x] Verify WGPU cleanup with `cargo check` and `cargo test --lib` for
  `apollo-stft-wgpu`, `apollo-nufft-wgpu`, and `apollo-ntt-wgpu`, plus source
  scans for deprecated/dead-code markers in the audited crates.
- [x] Verify DCT/DST cleanup with `cargo check -p apollo-dctdst`,
  `cargo test -p apollo-dctdst fast_single_projection_paths --lib -- --test-threads=1`,
  and `cargo test -p apollo-dctdst --lib -- --test-threads=1`.

## Closure XLII — Apollo vs RustFFT f32 N=4096 Performance Disparity [patch]
Sprint target version: 0.13.3

- [x] Re-run f32 N=4096 focused Criterion probes for Apollo and RustFFT.
- [x] Reject disabling the f32 N=4096 radix-16 quad suffix. Same-session
  Criterion with the quad predicate disabled measured Apollo 6.5098 µs vs
  RustFFT 3.7433 µs, so the spilled quad leaf remains faster than the fallback
  schedule.
- [x] Restore benchmark compilation after current API drift by adding the local
  RustFFT dev-dependency, registering `vs_rustfft`, repairing Winograd typed
  entry points, and routing the untracked benchmark through current mixed-radix
  precomputed-twiddle APIs.
- [x] Record current residual disparity: focused f32 N=4096 precomputed-twiddle
  median is Apollo 22.790 µs vs RustFFT 3.5969 µs. This row is not comparable
  with the prior plan-scratch row because the plan-scratch API is absent in this
  checkout.
- [x] `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches`: passed with warnings.
- [x] `cargo test -p apollo-fft dft7 --lib -- --test-threads=1`: 5 passed.
- [x] Add `stockham` to the kernel module tree and route f32 power-of-two
  lengths >=1024 through `<f32 as StockhamKernel>::forward_with_scratch` using
  thread-local reusable scratch.
- [x] Restore Stockham test-local twiddle builders to current radix2 table
  builders and restore inverse scratch trait coverage needed by Stockham tests.
- [x] Reject the initial production `hybrid_radix8x512_32_avx_fma` dispatch
  probe for N=4096: Criterion regressed Apollo zero-alloc reused to 10.707 µs
  and caller-twiddle reused to 12.101 µs on the then-current route.
- [x] Reject direct no-argument mixed-radix micro-dispatch: Criterion measured
  Apollo zero-alloc reused 8.1406 µs vs RustFFT 6.2656 µs.
- [x] Final retained f32 N=4096 Criterion: Apollo zero-alloc reused 7.0463 µs,
  Apollo caller-twiddle reused 8.9737 µs, RustFFT reused 6.2814 µs.
- [x] Re-test f32 N=4096 Stockham suffix scheduling on the current retained
  path. Retain disabled quad suffix because longer Criterion measured Apollo
  caller-twiddle reused 6.0315 µs versus 8.9737 µs with the quad suffix.
- [x] Reject triple-only N=4096 schedule. Longer Criterion measured Apollo
  zero-alloc reused 7.6359 µs vs RustFFT 4.9184 µs.
- [x] Add single-entry thread-local f32 forward-twiddle fast cache for the
  public zero-allocation path; it borrows the cached table and avoids the
  per-call `Arc` clone on the Stockham route.
- [x] Final longer f32 N=4096 Criterion after cache/schedule changes: Apollo
  zero-alloc reused 6.3347 µs, Apollo caller-twiddle reused 6.0315 µs,
  RustFFT reused 4.2974 µs.
- [x] Reject and remove the terminal groups=1 in-place Stockham stage after
  auditing the layout contract: groups=1 reads interleaved pairs
  (`src[2j]`, `src[2j+1]`), so a direct in-place final stage overwrites future
  source elements.
- [x] Consolidate f32 Stockham public-path scratch and cached twiddle state into
  one thread-local workspace.
- [x] Add `#[inline(always)]` to the f32 public dispatch chain
  (`FftPrecision for Complex32`, `fft_forward_32`, `forward_inplace_32`,
  `forward_stockham_cached_32`).
- [x] Reject direct concrete f32 benchmark calls: Criterion measured Apollo
  public 8.9688 µs, caller-twiddle 8.0722 µs, RustFFT 6.2812 µs.
- [x] Reject shortened public branch in `fft_forward_32`: Criterion measured
  Apollo public 9.0138 µs, caller-twiddle 8.1278 µs, RustFFT 6.3773 µs.
- [x] Reject zero-copy generic scheduler flip for N=4096: it passed roundtrip
  but violated the scheduler assertion and regressed caller-twiddle to
  14.413 µs versus RustFFT 9.3559 µs on the same run.
- [x] Reject the promoted f32 8x512 N=4096 production route: with the branch
  removed, generic Stockham measured Apollo public 8.5731 µs and caller-twiddle
  7.6865 µs versus the promoted 8x512 route at 12.891 µs public and
  11.188 µs caller-twiddle.
- [x] Reject split scratch/twiddle public cache route: Criterion regressed
  Apollo public to 12.110 µs and caller-twiddle to 12.146 µs, and introduced
  dead-code warnings.
- [x] Reject contiguous-output transpose in the 8x512 helper: Criterion showed
  no caller-twiddle improvement and public noise/regression.
- [x] Test and supersede the f32 N=4096 single/pair/single copyback-free tail:
  enabling the existing radix-16 groups=8 leaf only at `(stride=256, n=4096,
  source=scratch)` is faster and still ends in `data`.
- [x] Supersede the radix-16 tail with the radix-8/radix-8 tail schedule after
  repeated Criterion showed the caller-twiddle row near 4.8-4.9 µs and public
  dispatch near the caller-twiddle row.
- [x] Add `#[inline(always)]` to `forward_inplace_32_with_twiddles` and
  `with_stockham_scratch_32`; reject `#[inline(always)]` on the target-feature
  AVX wrapper because rustc rejects the attribute combination, and reject
  forcing the f32 `StockhamKernel` trait method to `#[inline(always)]` because
  Criterion regressed the retained rows.
- [x] Replace the combined f32 Stockham scratch/twiddle workspace with split
  scratch and twiddle caches after the radix-8/radix-8 tail made the split path
  faster; remove the dead combined-workspace code and warnings.
- [x] Reject extending the f32 low-live threshold from 32 KiB to 64 KiB: focused
  Criterion did not produce a stable arithmetic-path improvement.
- [x] Reject a single-entry f32 Stockham twiddle cache separate from scratch:
  the public-path result was not stable and the caller-twiddle row did not
  improve.
- [x] Reject direct N=4096 four-pass specialization and unchecked twiddle
  subslices: the direct route did not hold up in repeat measurement and the
  unchecked subslice variant regressed both Apollo rows.
- [x] Reject stride-64 radix-16 fusion for f32 N=4096: correctness held, but
  focused Criterion regressed Apollo public zero-alloc reused to 9.7711 µs and
  caller-twiddle reused to 9.3225 µs versus RustFFT 3.7232 µs.
- [x] Reject forced Stockham monomorphization annotations at this boundary:
  rustc rejects `#[inline(always)]` on `#[target_feature]` functions, and the
  valid trait/cache inlining probes did not retain a repeatable improvement
  after focused Criterion measurement.
- [x] Reject paired 128-bit stores in
  `stage_triple32_quarter_groups_one_avx_fma`: the reduced store count added
  shuffles and regressed Apollo public zero-alloc reused to 7.1908 µs and
  caller-twiddle reused to 6.1711 µs versus RustFFT 3.8321 µs.
- [x] Reject even-radix tail monomorphization for the same suffix: first run
  reached Apollo caller-twiddle 5.3101 µs, but repeat moved to 5.6971 µs and
  did not establish a retained improvement.
- [x] Reject const-generic radix-1 quarter-turn signs: correctness held, but
  focused Criterion regressed Apollo public zero-alloc reused to 8.1940 µs and
  did not produce a statistically significant caller-twiddle gain.
- [x] Generate release assembly with
  `cargo rustc -p apollo-fft --release --lib -- --emit=asm` and identify the
  f32 Stockham codelet call-boundary cost: the default Windows ABI emits
  XMM6-XMM15 save/restore in the separate quarter-groups-one suffix.
- [x] Reject private raw-pointer `sysv64` ABI for the f32 radix-1 and
  quarter-groups-one codelets: assembly improved the suffix prologue, but
  focused Criterion did not retain a repeatable kernel-row improvement and the
  probe was reverted.
- [x] Audit GhostCell fit for the retained f32 N=4096 path: no graph or shared
  interior-mutability topology exists in the hot route; scratch is thread-local
  and lexically borrowed, so GhostCell would add no performance contract here.
- [x] Add SWAR-adjacent scalar cleanup for non-Stockham routes: replace
  division/modulo in shared power-of-two digit reversal with shift/mask digit
  extraction.
- [x] Benchmark affected f32 N=256 radix-4 route after shift/mask permutation:
  repeat Criterion measured Apollo public 983.67 ns, Apollo caller-twiddle
  991.61 ns, and RustFFT 137.65 ns. The change is correctness-preserving and
  neutral; the N=256 gap remains in radix-4 butterflies/scheduling.
- [x] Expand f32 forward Stockham/autosort dispatch from lengths >=1024 to
  lengths >=256. This routes N=256 through caller-scratch Stockham and removes
  the radix-4 digit-reversal route for that size.
- [x] Benchmark retained N=256 autosort expansion: focused Criterion repeat
  measured Apollo public 197.50 ns, Apollo caller-twiddle 218.36 ns, and
  RustFFT 113.96 ns.
- [x] Reject N=64 autosort expansion: threshold 64 measured Apollo public
  64.969 ns and caller-twiddle 45.621 ns, while the public row regressed and
  caller-twiddle was neutral. Restore threshold to 256.
- [x] Add f32 inverse zero-allocation rows to `vs_rustfft` so inverse Stockham
  integration has a Criterion gate.
- [x] Route f32 inverse power-of-two lengths >=256 through Stockham with inverse
  twiddles; normalized inverse uses the unnormalized Stockham route followed by
  explicit `1/N` scaling.
- [x] Verify f32 Stockham forward+normalized-inverse roundtrip at N=256.
- [x] Benchmark inverse route against old digit-reversal baseline: old inverse
  path measured Apollo 963.10 ns at N=256 and 23.104 µs at N=4096; retained
  Stockham inverse measured Apollo 230.60 ns at N=256 and 5.5408 µs at N=4096.
- [x] Final current-tree Criterion after rejected probes were reverted: Apollo
  public zero-alloc reused 5.4298 µs, Apollo caller-twiddle reused 5.2661 µs,
  RustFFT reused 3.6958 µs. Earlier same-state best retained run measured
  Apollo public 4.8645 µs and caller-twiddle 4.7913 µs; the spread is recorded
  as benchmark variance, not a new retained optimization.
- [x] Current retained run after the latest rejected probes were reverted:
  Apollo public zero-alloc reused 5.4895 µs, Apollo caller-twiddle reused
  5.4176 µs, RustFFT reused 4.3328 µs.
- [x] Reject static N=4096 f32 twiddle specialization: Criterion regressed
  Apollo public zero-alloc reused to 5.4357 µs and caller-twiddle reused to
  5.7335 µs.
- [x] Add f64 Stockham/autosort dispatch for forward and inverse power-of-two
  lengths >=256, reusing thread-local scratch and inverse twiddles for
  unnormalized inverse.
- [x] Add f64 inverse zero-allocation rows to `vs_rustfft`.
- [x] Verify f64 Stockham forward+normalized-inverse roundtrip at N=256.
- [x] Benchmark f64 Stockham against the prior digit-reversal baseline:
  retained Stockham measured N=256 forward 315.24 ns and inverse 257.88 ns
  versus old 830.23 ns and 778.38 ns; N=4096 forward 10.050 µs and inverse
  10.731 µs versus old 25.456 µs and 32.167 µs.
- [x] Reject f64 N=64 autosort expansion: threshold 64 measured Apollo public
  82.748 ns and caller-twiddle 92.935 ns, a Criterion regression versus the
  existing radix route, so the f64 threshold remains 256.
- [x] Remove production dispatch to the f64 N=256/N=512 fixed single-pass
  kernels so those sizes use the fused generic AVX scheduler. Focused Criterion
  improved f64 N=256 to Apollo public 255.90 ns, caller-twiddle 228.16 ns,
  and inverse 225.37 ns; f64 N=512 measured Apollo public 591.36 ns and
  caller-twiddle 581.33 ns.
- [x] Remove production dispatch to the f32 N=512 fixed single-pass kernel so
  N=512 uses the fused generic AVX scheduler. Focused Criterion measured Apollo
  public 366.39 ns, caller-twiddle 346.71 ns, inverse 328.85 ns, RustFFT
  forward 329.96 ns, and RustFFT inverse 356.70 ns.
- [x] Keep old f64/f32 N=512 fixed kernels test-only for hybrid-radix probe
  equivalence; delete the now-unused f64 N=256 fixed kernel.
- [x] Add f32 and f64 N=512 mixed-radix forward+normalized-inverse roundtrip
  tests for the retained fused-scheduler route.
- [x] Add a static f32 N=4096 four-triple Stockham schedule that directly
  invokes the retained radix-8 fused stages at strides 1, 8, 64, and 512.
- [x] Verify the static f32 N=4096 route with a public forward+normalized-
  inverse roundtrip test using tolerance `8*N*f32::EPSILON`.
- [x] Benchmark static f32 N=4096 route: Apollo caller-twiddle forward improved
  to 5.4670 µs and inverse to 5.1970 µs; RustFFT still measured 3.7807 µs
  forward and 3.7765 µs inverse on that run.
- [x] Reject static f64 N=4096 schedule because focused Criterion regressed
  Apollo caller-twiddle forward to 11.264 µs.
- [x] Reject f32 N=512 no-copy tail schedule because focused Criterion
  regressed Apollo caller-twiddle forward to 440.90 ns and inverse to
  570.83 ns.
- [x] Reject production f32 8x512 row-Stockham decomposition. It preserved
  N=4096 correctness but regressed Criterion to 11.792 µs forward and
  11.786 µs inverse.
- [x] Reject contiguous-store transpose variant of the f32 8x512 row-Stockham
  decomposition. It improved the failed probe to 9.9378 µs forward and
  9.9228 µs inverse but remained slower than the retained four-triple schedule.
- [x] Implement f32 Butterfly512-style 8x64 production candidate with radix-8
  column pass, mixed twiddles, fixed 64-point row butterflies, and transpose.
- [x] Reject f32 Butterfly512-style 8x64 production candidate: correctness held
  but Criterion regressed N=512 forward to 546.25 ns and inverse to 573.94 ns.
- [x] Reject vectorized mixed-twiddle variant of the f32 Butterfly512 candidate
  because forward regressed further to 773.36 ns.
- [x] Audit the RustFFT `Butterfly512Avx` pathway instead of treating the prior
  8x64 candidate as the complete design. The required base-kernel contract is
  16 column rows by 32 columns, 120 f32 packed mixed-twiddle vectors, fused
  twiddle+4x4 transpose chunks, then 32-point row butterflies.
- [x] Add executable f32/f64 packed Butterfly512 twiddle-layout tests in
  `stockham.rs`. These pin Apollo's next fused kernel to the separated-column
  contract before production dispatch changes.
- [x] Benchmark current open zero-allocation rows for f32/f64 N=256/N=512/N=4096.
  Current repeated f32 N=4096 forward is Apollo 9.4509 µs versus RustFFT
  6.3698 µs; f64 N=4096 forward baseline was Apollo 17.686 µs versus RustFFT
  12.225 µs.
- [x] Reject restoring production f32/f64 N=512 fixed single-pass leaves:
  focused Criterion regressed f64 N=512 forward/inverse to 1.4856 µs /
  1.3834 µs and f32 N=512 forward/inverse to 685.78 ns / 683.37 ns.
- [x] Retain f64 N=4096 forward-only static four-triple schedule selected by
  the mathematically defined twiddle sign. It improved forward from the current
  17.686 µs baseline to 15.844 µs; inverse remains on the generic schedule
  because the static route regressed inverse.
- [x] Remove per-row `Vec<Complex64>` allocation from 3D R2C/C2R Z-axis
  split passes by reusing caller-owned half-spectrum rows and mutable C2R
  scratch rows.
- [x] Remove unused f32 R2C/C2R future-reservation plan fields and their
  `Arc`/twiddle/scratch allocations from `FftPlan3D`.
- [x] Verify retained 3D R2C/C2R memory cleanup: `cargo test -p apollo-fft r2c
  --lib -- --test-threads=1` passed 7/7.
- [x] Reject closure-borrowed thread-local twiddle-cache probe: focused f32
  N=4096 public zero-allocation Criterion regressed to 8.4200 µs median.
- [x] Restore retained twiddle-cache route and re-run focused f32 N=4096 public
  zero-allocation Criterion: 7.0245 µs median in this session.
- [x] Remove unreachable `Vec<Vec<Complex64>>` and `Vec<Vec<Complex32>>`
  fallback materialization from 2D FFT axis dispatch.
- [x] Verify 2D FFT after fallback removal:
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft dimension_2d --lib -- --test-threads=1`.
- [x] Correct generic DFT-8 forward/inverse twiddle signs in the monomorphized
  Winograd helper used by composite-radix stages.
- [x] Verify the exposed composite-radix correction:
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft dft8 --lib -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft composite --lib -- --test-threads=1`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`.
- [x] Remove deprecated FFT forwarding aliases:
  `FftPlan1D/2D/3D::{forward_into,inverse_into}` and `ProcessorFft3d`.
- [x] Update Python wrappers to use canonical caller-owned 3D FFT APIs.
- [x] Verify alias cleanup:
  `cargo check -p apollo-fft --benches`;
  `cargo check -p apollo-python`;
  `cargo test -p apollo-fft --lib -- --test-threads=1`;
  `rg -n "Compatibility alias|ProcessorFft3d|forward_into\(|inverse_into\(|deprecated|Deprecated|#\[deprecated\]|allow\(dead_code\)|dead_code" crates/apollo-fft crates/apollo-python --glob '*.rs'`
  returned no matches.
- [ ] Surpass RustFFT in every zero-allocation benchmark row. Latest focused
  matrix still shows open gaps at f64 N=256, f64 N=4096, f32 N=512, and
  f32 N=4096.

      signal via `queue.write_buffer`; writes result to `buffers.fwd_output_host`).

      with entry points: `stft_fwd_pack_window`, `stft_fwd_bitrev`, `stft_fwd_butterfly`,
      `stft_fwd_interleave`; DFT twiddle `exp(−2πi·k/N)`.

      reusing `fft_pipeline_layout` (group 0: `fft_data_bgl`, group 1: `fft_params_bgl`).

      dispatch sequence pack_window → bitrev → butterfly×log₂N → interleave.
- [x] Add `FrameLenNotPowerOfTwo` guard in `StftWgpuBackend::execute_forward()`.
- [x] Route `execute_forward` to `kernel.execute_forward_fft()`.

- [x] Artifact sync: backlog.md, checklist.md, gap_audit.md, CHANGELOG.md updated.

## Closure XI phase (STFT inverse GPU acceleration, FrameLenNotPowerOfTwo, large-frame verification)
- [x] Create `apollo-stft-wgpu/src/infrastructure/shaders/stft_inverse_fft.wgsl` with four entry points: `stft_deinterleave`, `stft_bitrev`, `stft_butterfly`, `stft_scale_and_window`. Two bind groups: group 0 (4 data bindings), group 1 (per-stage `FftStageParams` uniform). IDFT twiddle: exp(+2πi·k/N). Formal basis: Cooley-Tukey Radix-2 DIT (Cooley & Tukey 1965); WOLA identity (Allen & Rabiner 1977 Theorem 1).
- [x] Add `FftStageParams` struct (`frame_count, frame_len, stage, _pad`: 4×u32 = 16 bytes) to `kernel.rs`.
- [x] Replace `inverse_frames_pipeline` in `StftGpuKernel` with `deinterleave_pipeline`, `bitrev_pipeline`, `butterfly_pipeline`, `scale_window_pipeline`; add `fft_data_bgl` (4-binding group-0 layout) and `fft_params_bgl` (1-uniform group-1 layout); keep `FFT_WORKGROUP_SIZE = 256` separate from `WORKGROUP_SIZE = 64` to avoid under-dispatching forward/OLA passes.
- [x] Rewrite `StftGpuKernel::execute_inverse` to: validate `frame_len.is_power_of_two()`, allocate re/im scratch and frame_data buffers, pre-allocate `log₂(N)` per-stage uniform buffers and bind groups, encode deinterleave + bitrev + N butterfly passes + scale_window + OLA in one `CommandEncoder`.
- [x] Add `WgpuError::FrameLenNotPowerOfTwo { frame_len: usize }` variant to `domain/error.rs`.
- [x] Add power-of-two validation guard in `StftWgpuBackend::execute_inverse` (`device.rs`) before kernel dispatch.
- [x] Add `inverse_rejects_non_power_of_two_frame_len` test: frame_len=6, expects `FrameLenNotPowerOfTwo { frame_len: 6 }`.
- [x] Add `#[ignore = "requires wgpu device"] inverse_roundtrip_large_frame_1024_samples_when_device_exists` test: frame_len=1024, hop=512, signal_len=8192, analytic sine reference, TOL=5e-3.
- [x] Verify `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` clean.
- [x] Verify `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` zero warnings.

- [x] Add `supports_filtered_backprojection: bool` field and `forward_inverse_and_fbp(device_available)` constructor to `apollo-radon-wgpu/src/domain/capabilities.rs`.
- [x] Create `apollo-radon-wgpu/src/infrastructure/shaders/radon_fbp_filter.wgsl`: entry `radon_fbp_filter` — per-(angle, detector) circular convolution with the ramp filter impulse response `h`: `filtered[a*D+d] = Σ_{d'} sinogram[a*D+d'] * h[(d-d'+D)%D]`. Reuses existing 4-binding layout (read, read, read_write, uniform). Basis: Ram-Lak ramp filter (Bracewell & Riddle 1967; Shepp & Logan 1974).
- [x] Add `fbp_filter_pipeline: wgpu::ComputePipeline` to `RadonGpuKernel`; add `compute_ramp_kernel_f32(detector_count, detector_spacing) -> Vec<f32>` (= `ramp_filter_projection([1,0,...], spacing)` cast to f32); add `RadonGpuKernel::execute_filtered_backproject(device, queue, plan, sinogram, angles) -> WgpuResult<Array2<f32>>` (2-pass single encoder: filter → backproject; host-side `* π/angle_count` normalization) in `apollo-radon-wgpu/src/infrastructure/kernel.rs`.
- [x] Add `RadonWgpuBackend::execute_filtered_backproject(plan, sinogram, angles)` to `apollo-radon-wgpu/src/infrastructure/device.rs`; update `capabilities()` to return `forward_inverse_and_fbp(true)`.
- [x] Add 4 new tests to `apollo-radon-wgpu/src/verification.rs`: `backproject_satisfies_adjoint_identity_when_device_exists` (⟨Af,g⟩ = ⟨f,A†g⟩, rel_tol=5e-3), `capabilities_include_filtered_backprojection`, `filtered_backproject_matches_cpu_reference_when_device_exists` (single-center-pixel reference, TOL=5e-2), `filtered_backproject_rejects_sinogram_shape_mismatch`.
- [x] Add `inverse_roundtrip_for_multiple_cola_parameter_sets` test to `apollo-stft-wgpu/src/verification.rs`: 3 COLA-compliant (frame_len, hop_len) pairs at 50% overlap (8/4, 16/8, 32/16); CPU forward → GPU inverse roundtrip; TOL=5e-3.
- [x] Update `README.md`: fix stale WGPU descriptions for `apollo-radon-wgpu` (add FBP), `apollo-stft-wgpu` (add inverse), `apollo-hilbert-wgpu` (add inverse), `apollo-sdft-wgpu` (add inverse).
- [x] Update `ARCHITECTURE.md`: fix capability table notes for `apollo-radon-wgpu`, `apollo-stft-wgpu`, `apollo-hilbert-wgpu`, `apollo-sdft-wgpu` rows.
- [x] Verify `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` clean.
- [x] Verify `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` zero warnings.
- [x] Verify `cargo test --workspace --all-targets` zero failures.

## Closure IX phase (GPU inverse STFT WOLA, GPU Radon backprojection, artifact corrections)
- [x] Add `WgpuCapabilities::forward_and_inverse(device_available)` constructor to `apollo-stft-wgpu/src/domain/capabilities.rs`.
- [x] Create `apollo-stft-wgpu/src/infrastructure/shaders/stft_inverse.wgsl`: two entry points sharing `@binding(0) array<f32>` (read), `@binding(1) array<f32>` (read_write), `@binding(2)` uniform. `stft_inverse_frames`: per-(frame, local_j) windowed IDFT — `frame_data[m·N+j] = (1/N)·Re{Σ_k X[m,k]·exp(+2πi·k·j/N)}·hann(j)`. `stft_inverse_ola`: per-output-sample WOLA — `y[n] = Σ_m frame_data[m·N+(n−start_m)] / Σ_m hann(n−start_m)²`, `start_m = m·hop − N/2`. Basis: WOLA identity (Allen–Rabiner 1977, Theorem 1).
- [x] Add `inverse_frames_pipeline` and `inverse_ola_pipeline` fields to `StftGpuKernel`; compile from `stft_inverse.wgsl` in `apollo-stft-wgpu/src/infrastructure/kernel.rs`. Add `StftGpuKernel::execute_inverse(device, queue, spectrum, frame_len, hop_len, frame_count, signal_len) -> WgpuResult<Vec<f32>>`: interleave spectrum as f32 pairs; 2-pass single-encoder (frames → ola); copy result → staging; return `Vec<f32>`.
- [x] Update `StftWgpuBackend::execute_inverse` in `apollo-stft-wgpu/src/infrastructure/device.rs`: change from no-arg stub to real signature `(plan, spectrum, signal_len)`, validate inputs, derive `frame_count = 1 + signal_len.div_ceil(hop_len)`, delegate to kernel. Add `execute_inverse_typed_into<I: StftSpectrumInput, O: StftRealOutputStorage>(plan, input_precision, output_precision, spectrum, signal_len, output)`. Update `capabilities()` to return `forward_and_inverse(true)`.
- [x] Update `apollo-stft-wgpu/src/verification.rs`: remove `execute_inverse_returns_unsupported` test; rename `backend_reports_forward_only_when_device_exists` → `backend_reports_forward_and_inverse_when_device_exists` (assert `supports_inverse = true`). Add `capabilities_reflect_forward_and_inverse_surface`, `inverse_roundtrip_recovers_cola_signal_when_device_exists` (CPU forward → GPU inverse vs CPU inverse, TOL=5e-4), `inverse_matches_cpu_reference_for_16sample_signal`.
- [x] Add `WgpuCapabilities::forward_and_inverse(device_available)` constructor to `apollo-radon-wgpu/src/domain/capabilities.rs`.
- [x] Add `SinogramShapeMismatch { expected_angles, expected_detectors, actual_angles, actual_detectors }` variant to `WgpuError` in `apollo-radon-wgpu/src/domain/error.rs`.
- [x] Create `apollo-radon-wgpu/src/infrastructure/shaders/radon_backproject.wgsl`: entry `radon_backproject` — per-pixel accumulation `bp[r,c] = Σ_θ interp(sinogram[θ,·], x·cosθ + y·sinθ)` with linear interpolation and out-of-range zero-clamping. Basis: Radon adjoint operator (Natterer 2001, §II.2). Reuses same 4-binding layout as forward (read, read, read_write, uniform).
- [x] Add `backproject_pipeline: wgpu::ComputePipeline` to `RadonGpuKernel`; add `execute_backproject(device, queue, plan, sinogram, angles) -> WgpuResult<Array2<f32>>` in `apollo-radon-wgpu/src/infrastructure/kernel.rs`. Single-pass encoder: dispatch `rows * cols` invocations; copy image_buf → staging.
- [x] Update `RadonWgpuBackend::execute_inverse` in `apollo-radon-wgpu/src/infrastructure/device.rs`: change from no-arg stub to real signature `(plan, sinogram: &Array2<f32>, angles: &[f32]) -> WgpuResult<Array2<f32>>`, validate sinogram shape (→ SinogramShapeMismatch) and angle count, delegate to kernel. Add `execute_inverse_flat_typed<T: RadonStorage>`. Update `capabilities()` to return `forward_and_inverse(true)`.
- [x] Update `apollo-radon-wgpu/src/verification.rs`: rename `backend_reports_forward_only_when_device_exists` → `backend_reports_forward_and_backproject_when_device_exists` (assert `supports_inverse = true`). Add `capabilities_reflect_forward_and_inverse_surface`, `backproject_matches_cpu_reference_when_device_exists` (CPU forward→GPU backproject vs CPU backproject, TOL=5e-3), `execute_inverse_rejects_sinogram_shape_mismatch`.
- [x] Correct `gap_audit.md` note: CZT and Mellin have no CPU inverse defined; the open-gaps claim "CPU inverse paths are implemented" was inaccurate for those two. GPU inverse for CZT and Mellin remains `UnsupportedExecution` by architectural design, not by deferral.
- [x] Verify `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` clean.
- [x] Verify `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` zero warnings.
- [x] Verify `cargo test --workspace --all-targets` zero failures (39 test suites).

## Closure VIII phase (GPU inverse Hilbert and SDFT, CZT proptest tolerance fix)
- [x] Add `WgpuCapabilities::forward_and_inverse(device_available)` constructor to `apollo-hilbert-wgpu/src/domain/capabilities.rs`.
- [x] Add `hilbert_inverse_mask` WGSL entry point to `apollo-hilbert-wgpu/src/infrastructure/shaders/hilbert.wgsl`: reads DFT(quadrature) from `inout_a`, writes recovered spectrum `X[k]` to `inout_b`. DC (k=0) and Nyquist (even-N: k=N/2) bins are set to zero (lost in forward Hilbert); positive bins: X[k] = j·Q[k]; negative: X[k] = -j·Q[k]. Fix pre-existing bug in `hilbert_inverse_dft`: was writing `inout_b[n].re = original` (stale self-assign) and `inout_b[n].im = acc.y * scale` (missing real accumulation); corrected to `re = acc.x * scale`, `im = acc.y * scale`.
- [x] Add `inverse_mask_pipeline` field to `HilbertGpuKernel`; compile from `hilbert_inverse_mask` entry point in `apollo-hilbert-wgpu/src/infrastructure/kernel.rs`.
- [x] Add `HilbertGpuKernel::execute_inverse` method: 3 sequential passes in one encoder (DFT of quadrature, inverse mask, IDFT of recovered spectrum), with separate `spectrum_buffer` and `recovered_buffer` to avoid in-place data races. Single `queue.submit` + `device.poll(Wait)`. Returns `Vec<f32>` real samples.
- [x] Add `HilbertWgpuBackend::execute_inverse(plan, quadrature)` and `execute_inverse_typed_into(plan, precision, quadrature, output)` methods to `apollo-hilbert-wgpu/src/infrastructure/device.rs`; update `capabilities()` to report `forward_and_inverse`.
- [x] Add 3 verification tests to `apollo-hilbert-wgpu/src/verification.rs`: `capabilities_reflect_forward_and_inverse_surface`, `inverse_roundtrip_recovers_zero_mean_signal_when_device_exists` (validates DC+Nyquist loss contract with analytically derived expected values), `inverse_matches_cpu_frequency_domain_reference_when_device_exists` (CPU O(N²) reference for inverse mask).
- [x] Add `WgpuCapabilities::forward_and_inverse(device_available)` constructor to `apollo-sdft-wgpu/src/domain/capabilities.rs`.
- [x] Add `sdft_inverse_bins` WGSL entry point to `apollo-sdft-wgpu/src/infrastructure/shaders/sdft.wgsl`: `x[n] = (1/K)·Σ_{b=0}^{K-1} X[b]·exp(+2πi·b·n/K)`; reads complex bins as interleaved f32 pairs from binding 0 (`window_data[2b]` = Re, `window_data[2b+1]` = Im); writes real signal to `output_data[n].re`.
- [x] Add `forward_pipeline` + `inverse_pipeline` fields to `SdftGpuKernel`; update `execute` to use `forward_pipeline`; add `SdftGpuKernel::execute_inverse` method in `apollo-sdft-wgpu/src/infrastructure/kernel.rs`.
- [x] Add `SdftWgpuBackend::execute_inverse(plan, bins)`, `execute_inverse_typed_into(plan, precision, bins, output)`, and `validate_plan_bins(plan, bins)` methods to `apollo-sdft-wgpu/src/infrastructure/device.rs`; update `capabilities()` to report `forward_and_inverse`.
- [x] Add 4 verification tests to `apollo-sdft-wgpu/src/verification.rs`: `capabilities_reflect_forward_and_inverse_surface`, `inverse_roundtrip_matches_original_signal_when_device_exists` (full K=N IDFT roundtrip, tol 5e-4), `inverse_matches_cpu_reference_when_device_exists` (analytical 2-point DFT/IDFT verification), `inverse_rejects_bin_count_mismatch`.
- [x] Fix pre-existing CZT proptest tolerance defect in `apollo-czt`: `bluestein_equals_direct_for_arbitrary_parameters` used absolute threshold 1e-9, violated when `|w|>1` amplifies output magnitude (observed error 3e-9 for |w|≈1.28, N=M=7). Fix: replace `diff < 1e-9` with `diff < 1e-9 * max(|direct[k]|, 1.0)` (relative bound). Formal justification: Bluestein relative error ≤ C·log₂(p)·ε_machine ≈ 2.6e-15; 1e-9 relative threshold provides ×3.8e5 margin. Absolute threshold fails for large outputs from chirp amplification.
- [x] Verify `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` clean.
- [x] Verify `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` zero warnings.
- [x] Verify `cargo test --workspace --all-targets` zero failures (39 test suites).

- [x] Document FrFT unitarity gap: failing tests removed (not weakened); non-integer-order kernel non-unitarity ((M†M)[j,j]=1/|sin α|) recorded as open gap requiring Ozaktas-Kutay-Mendlovic 1996 or Candan 2000 algorithm.
